"The review of r code was too fast and complex for me to follow. I'd love to use that strategy for determining power and ideal sample size, but I couldn't follow.",2020-02-10 14:53:04
Important topic. I feel like this procedure for determining good and bad controls is a bit convoluted. I feel like there's a simpler shorthand. Does another factor influence both x and y? Does another factor influence x? What's wrong with that simpler algorithm?,2020-02-10 14:52:08
"I wish the content of this class would've been covered in application section rather than section, so that people who are curious to hear the answers can attend. I'm a little bummed we didn't use the time to cover mediation / moderation (*hugely* important concepts in behavioral research....). That said, I appreciate that Tobi put in the effort to really understand the questions from the class!",2020-02-10 14:51:39
"I didn't understand the final explanation today (of control variables). What did you mean by causal path? I mean, this is just correlation, right? So when you add a beta coefficient to your path, we'd get an inverse path the other way around, right? In that case, though, we shouldn't get a difference between the first and second example, but we did. Anyway, just a little confused.",2020-02-10 14:51:33
"As usual, your diagrams and slides were clear. Thank you! There was not a lot of time for us to pause and think during the lecture, it would have helped with deciphering some of the diagrams.",2020-02-10 14:51:29
"I appreciate the conceptual walkthrough of identifying good and bad controls! I have literally never had a class teach me how to identify this. Something more general I've been feeling is it would be helpful to have some cross-referencing back between the model comparison approach and the recipe approach. How does this conceptual approach to controls work for when we enter many demographics (ex. age, gender, grade) into a model?  Also, it would be awesome if we could have some extra resources (sorry if these are in the syllabus and I missed them!) about applying more complex mediation/moderation models like Hayes",2020-02-10 14:51:25
Thanks for focusing on controls! I think some tangible examples would be helpful in understanding. I'm also still confused as to how adding a control could increase the relationship between X and Y. Thank you!,2020-02-10 14:51:22
"Great explanation of degree of freedoms. Great explanation of what controlling for variables does. I was also happy that we went over the power analysis with the t.test, because it will be very useful for the last questions of the midterm exam!",2020-02-10 14:51:08
Thought it was a valiant attempt at trying to explain d-separation! Bayesian Networks theory from engineering has some possibly good explanations as well. :),2020-02-10 14:50:56
It may be helpful to give some concrete examples for the control variable problem. I would also like to hear how the last question in HW4 can be understood under the framework of d-separation.,2020-02-10 14:50:47
"'-Some signposts during the lecture would be appreciated (clearer indication that we are transitioning between topics and clearer articulation of the ""why"" behind concepts)",2020-02-10 14:50:45
"Even after going over the power analysis more in depth, I think many of us are still very confused about the specifics of the code (and what each code chunk does). Would it be possible to buzz over this again, but with a little more detail paid to the actual code instead of the theory?",2020-02-10 14:50:34
I liked the Mike Frank blog post! Nice to tie this lesson back into the stuff from Psych 251,2020-02-10 14:50:29
"The R is always confusing to learn in lecture style. I did like the visualization of the theoretical concepts. Still very very confused about ""controlling"" for variables (probably more confused then before the lecture, but I guess that's a good thing...)",2020-02-10 14:50:24
The degrees of freedom explanation was very helpful.,2020-02-10 14:50:19
Very helpful discussion of degrees of freedom as well as when you should (and should not) control for variables. It would have been nice to have a more interactive component in R.,2020-02-10 14:50:17
"I think it'd be great if you could go over what happens if you want to control for more than 1 variable and what that then means. I also didn't understand how controlling vs. confounding was relevant/meant in the context of today's class, since it felt like that part was a bit rushed at the end.",2020-02-10 14:50:15
Helpful answers to the questions left open from last lectures!,2020-02-10 14:50:11
The graphic model was a little confusing and I could follow the last part that distinguished good and bad controls,2020-02-10 14:50:10
Great to get more clarity about degrees of freedom and controlling for variables.,2020-02-10 14:49:57
"I was confused by the second example, when Z is NOT good to control for. I did not fully understand the explanation or the diagrams.",2020-02-10 14:49:56
'-It would be nice to get examples of what these concepts look like in actual studies/research applications,2020-02-10 14:49:55
Keep up the good meme work.,2020-02-10 14:49:45
