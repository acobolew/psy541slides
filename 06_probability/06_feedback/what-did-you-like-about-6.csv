"I think the lecture can benefit from two key changes: (1) spending more time motivating each new concept. It was unclear to me, for instance, why is it that we care about having fewer parameters. Answering the question: (2) I think the rain/sprinklers example was not effective at illustrating what seeing the world through Bayesian networks buys us (still unclear to me). Perhaps a more intuitive example, in addition to contrasting how a frequentist would approach the same question, may get us there. Thanks again for your hard work. It's not easy to communicate these concepts!",2019-01-18 11:56:13
"I like the lecture, but a few things: 1) can you please upload the the lecture note before class? Concepts of probability are hard and it makes the class even harder to follow when there was no notes and I wasn't able to mark my notes on the lecture notes. 2) perhaps you may consider to be time efficient in spending less time at the beginning about feedback and homework, but spending more time to explain something abstract, important and the ""core component"" of the lecture! Thanks, generally, the class is still good, but really needs to be time-efficient and not to rush at the end (happens a number of time)",2019-01-18 11:54:45
"This is very trivial, but it would be helpful if the slides are numbered so we can jot down the number of specific slides to review later. Still wrapping my mind around Bayesian but it's a good start!",2019-01-18 11:53:33
"It was a little fast for me but packed a lot of information which was good to learn! I think I had trouble with the intuition for how this would track onto the kind of experiments/analyses/data we would be looking at for psychological studies, but the last slide with the A-> B and B->A helped",2019-01-18 11:53:29
one more practice problem for probability would have been great.,2019-01-18 11:53:28
I really liked the exercise - maybe would have been good to have some more interactive parts during the explanations of bayes nets.,2019-01-18 11:53:18
"Are there recommendations for reading more about the material today posted on the website, like what you put at the bottom of the Rmd files in the past? Also, could we take time to work out the math of some of the equations you used?",2019-01-18 11:53:11
I liked that we got into theoretical material. I think maybe whiteboard work or slide animations would have helped me follow step to step what we're doing.,2019-01-18 11:53:10
Fun explanation on probability. Would like more time to do examples and work them out ourselves.,2019-01-18 11:53:10
Happy to get into the meat of this course! I'm trying to convert all these math formulas into intuitions... I think I'll be able to [it's a good way for me to cement what I know],2019-01-18 11:53:04
Just want to be sure these slides will be posted. It would be helpful to be able to go through them again.,2019-01-18 11:53:00
I love the material. I appreciate that you are teaching them. I just feel like we were a bit rushed. Perhaps by doing a lot more homework we can get up to speed with them.,2019-01-18 11:52:57
"Thank you for a great lecture. Will we be reviewing probability again or should we review additional materials if we are still confused? If so, do you have any suggestions?",2019-01-18 11:52:45
more time on the later interesting sections! maybe less time on showing examples in the beginning--lecture really started at 10:50,2019-01-18 11:52:44
"Super helpful review of probability. A bit fast, but the figures and the examples helped! (Especially CLUE)",2019-01-18 11:52:41
It would be helpful to have exercises that ylwould enable us to practice the content you're teaching during class so we can get feedback.,2019-01-18 11:52:41
"I am pretty lost with the Bayes inference. The 16% example was good b/c I still don't know why it's true. I'll just have to work through more of this on my own, but I hope to revisit some of these to make sure we really get it.",2019-01-18 11:52:40
Three comments on this lecture:,2019-01-18 11:52:39
The examples of disease and garden grass are fun!,2019-01-18 11:52:38
"I liked the use of Clue as an example, very relatable and makes me want to play board games during the long weekend",2019-01-18 11:52:37
I enjoyed the clue review of probability. Would be great to spend more time on causal Bayesian networks as I've never seen them before,2019-01-18 11:52:35
