What did you like about today's class? What could be improved next time?
Response
"If there was recordings of this classes (from the previous years), it will be great. Gives us a chance to relook at the content."
"I appreciate you showing intuition, plus math, plus examples!"
Hard
"I appreciated the Clue example, it made it fun and helpful to ground in the meaning of the probabilities."
I liked having the actual examples and that we worked through an example together
Nice-- Even though we had some tech issues we made it through without feeling too rushed!
LIked the examples
Interesting! Would be better if the functions in the code can be given in a separate sheet :)
"I think it was great to have a few practice problems to apply the things we learned about Bayes' rule, and getting the examples at the very end about how this might apply to psychological research/human reasoning. It's also great we started with the very basics, and that the related notation was explained, because not everyone may have already been familiar with it."
Concepts were well-motivated and it was nice to see how to perform computations in R. A little slow on the conceptual side. :)
It was nice! But some R practice problems might have been usefyl
I think it was out of our control bc tech issues but the speed was a bit high
I really liked the examples and when we were solving the problems! I think it would be nice to walk through the little screenshots of R code a little slower if possible!
