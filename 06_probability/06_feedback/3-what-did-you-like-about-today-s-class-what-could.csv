Tobi's explanation of Bayes' theorem using a probability tree was extremely helpful! The explanation where we added rectangles was less useful.
"My stats are really, really rusty. It took a while (and some more effort needed) to wrap my head around the concepts. Looking forward, I think I just need some practice to get the wheel moving again."
Could we see the results of how long people reported the HW took? Same with the grade distribution for HWs (when that is available). Would be a useful metric
I downloaded the class files for today thinking it would be the lecture slides but it was the R code. Would it be possible to get the slides themselves used for the lecture to notetake on?
appreciated the break even though we were running short on time!
I really like the Clue example -- one of my favorite games.
I really liked the fact that you walked us through the bayesian formula using the ipad drawing/writing feature
"I liked that it was really interactive, and loved the Clue example!"
This class felt very foundational -- material I'd seen several times before (and I didn't major in stats or anything). Sadly disappointed that not everyone just did Bayes thm in their head for the disease example. Guess maybe my background is less typical than I'd thought.
Break-out porblem-solving to internalize concepts and better understand theory in practice
I really liked the dog meme coin.
I appreciated the Clue example! I found it super easy to follow
