"I think it will be nice to have more lectures on Bayes. I wonder if Bayesian analysis is usually taught compared to frequentist like our class, or compared to connectionist analysis?",2019-03-08 11:50:09
"I'm still struggling with developing an intuition for bayesian inference (and I might just need more exposure to the materials). For me, the more concrete the example, the better. I also found myself forgetting how the posterior was generated, so a quick recap from Wednesday would have been helpful for me. It seems ambitious to cover it in 3 days, but still learning a lot!",2019-03-08 11:49:46
"Overall, the lecture is good and the course materials are very comprehensive for a nice introduction to Bayesian statistics. But it is hard to cover everything (the exciting new stuffs) quickly at the end. For example, you may need to explain a bit more clearer why ordinal logistic regression works better in a Bayesian framework but not frequentist framework, this part is still not very clear to me. But generally, the lecture is really good, thanks for putting together all the nice materials.",2019-03-08 11:49:38
"Bayesian is cool! I'd suggest going deeper with fewer examples. Brms is easy to use, but without profound understanding of what exactly the model is doing, people won't have confidence to use it and talk about it.",2019-03-08 11:49:03
"Today's examples were exciting! It might be nice next quarter to have more time for them so that we have to actually work through examples before the quarter ends. As it is, I'm excited about investigating Bayes but it's unlikely I'll be able to spend much time on it since it's the end of the quarter. Thank you, though for the materials you suggested. They are really great!",2019-03-08 11:49:00
"I am still confused about a lot of Bayes, but not sure exactly what confuses me. Hoping practice with the homework helps. If not: DataCamp.",2019-03-08 11:48:47
"My research bases a lot on categorical data, so I wished we had covered more of the latter part of the syllabus (of logistic regression and Bayesian) earlier and deeper",2019-03-08 11:48:39
"Everything about this class is great. However, I think it would be good if there was like a one page information sheet that listed all of the methods in this class and the conditions under which you would use them. This could be a helpful references for future research and easy was of figuring out which of the methods are useful for various circumstances.",2019-03-08 11:48:37
"It seems like so much of understanding Bayes is going to come down to working with the code itself. But as of now, you've made a good case that we should be excited and invested in learning to use Bayes as a tool.",2019-03-08 11:48:34
"I wish we spent more time on Bayesian statistics. You certainly gave us enough to get started on our own, which I appreciate greaty, but an additional week would have terrific.",2019-03-08 11:48:30
Definitely a drinking from the fire hose lecture but well-structured. Will go through r codes to get a better digestion,2019-03-08 11:48:29
"Trying to cover all of Bayes statistics in one week felt very rushed. It's great to have an overview, but I think it makes more sense to discuss moderations and mediations before jumping to Bayes",2019-03-08 11:48:25
I really enjoyed the Bayesian section!  I think I would've liked more material covering this. But I recognize that it's probably hard to fit everything in. I will probably do the DataCamp for it. :),2019-03-08 11:48:24
This content is highly conceptual and I'm still struggling with understanding when I would use Bayesian vs. frequentist when answering real world problems.,2019-03-08 11:48:17
Wish we had more concrete/practical walkthrough examples with Bayes like we had for lm and lmer.,2019-03-08 11:48:16
I liked how we talked about different distributions that might arise in our psych research - the cool examples were indeeed cool,2019-03-08 11:48:15
I lost you in the beginning of the class but when you started to talk about the scalers I began to pay attention.,2019-03-08 11:48:04
I like the Bayes stuff we have learned so far. Would love to see/do even more,2019-03-08 11:47:55
