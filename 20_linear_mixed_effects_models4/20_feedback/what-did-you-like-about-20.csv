"not about class, but the way that you have been announcing dates for things is not ideal. You said the homework would be released on saturday night. When I look at the Canvas folders for the homework assignment, they all say Sunday or Monday. It was late. You moved the due date for the homework back one day because the homework was to be posted one day late. But it was more than that. I think, when I first checked, it said files were uploaded Sunday morning at 1am. For all intents and purposes, that's a homework pushed back from Friday to Sunday morning. That's fine,  I understand life happens. On our homework assignments, we lose points for the style of our coding. Unfortunately, I will have to deduct 3 points from the teaching team for assignment and grade posting style. It would be better if you just posted things during the day, or simply adjust your messaging. Some of us care about grades, and if you are planing to post grades at 11:45 on Wednesday night, just tell us they'll be posted Thursday.",2020-02-26 21:06:53
"Thank you for providing interpretations on the graphs as well as the issues that were problematic with them. It was a bit difficult to make jump into log odds without doing the math ourselves, but the slides lay it out well. I would still incorporate more time to talk to a neighbor for example when interpreting log odds.",2020-02-26 14:52:35
"I would have liked to go through the math transformations a bit more slowly. The part where you transform from a y, to a probability, to odds, to log of odds. I didn't fully understand every step there and would have wanted to go through it a bit more slowly.",2020-02-26 14:50:28
"The classes on linear mixed effects and this class were great! I was able to understand things that I hadn't understood before. I particularly appreciated the material on how to interpret the coefficients of logistic regression! Thanks for these great classes, Tobi!",2020-02-26 14:50:19
"I'd like to hear more explanations about how the concepts we learn are related to each other. For example, how is partial pooling related to linear mixed effects model?",2020-02-26 14:50:08
One thing in general that I feel like I still don't have a good sense of us how to model likert style data. I don't really have an idea of what a good strategy would be.,2020-02-26 14:50:02
"I really appreciate learning about the mixed models and multilevel modeling, it is super helpful for research! One thing that could be helpful in improving is giving a high-level definition of new concepts before jumping into the stats breakdown. For example, ""we use a logit transform to do X"" before all of the complicated formulas appear, I got really lost there. (And also with concepts like AIC/BIC)",2020-02-26 14:50:01
Oye. I'm lost. I still don't understand how to interpret these outputs very well.,2020-02-26 14:49:59
"I enjoyed this and the prior classes on mixed effects models. These are two concepts/tests that I'm using in my research and have had trouble with, so I was looking forward to these two topics. It was well taught and useful.",2020-02-26 14:49:52
"I like the application of the models, it gives me more confidence when using them in my data.",2020-02-26 14:49:51
Clear explanations on logistic regression. Moving forward I really hope to know how we can address non-normality of residuals in our linear models.,2020-02-26 14:49:39
Thank you for the detailed explanations. And for allowing me record the class for my colleagues. They are appreciative!,2020-02-26 14:49:36
"I think the class went well util the slide 50 or so. Then it went too fast. I finally followed most of the lecture, after 3 sessions in which I've been mostly lost.",2020-02-26 14:49:35
"I thought the explanation of logistic regression was great!! I've had people try to explain it to me a few times, and your explanation was by far the best and most intuitive. Overall, I thought the explanations for lmers and logistic regressions were really good.",2020-02-26 14:49:33
"Really important topic, well explained! What odds mean/how to intuitively interpret them is still not intuitive to me, though",2020-02-26 14:49:26
The pace of this class was good. I appreciate ongoing returns to the model comparison approach.,2020-02-26 14:49:25
The math makes things more transparent. I appreciate that.,2020-02-26 14:49:21
"Monday's class was really great, well paced and I was able to follow. Today you have kind of lost me, but may be on me,",2020-02-26 14:49:14
I'm honestly a bit lost...,2020-02-26 14:49:02
