"I have feedback about the homework. The first problem, with the pivot_longer and pivot_wider, was WAY TOO DIFFICULT. We are all of us new to the pivot functions, so none of us have yet built up an intuition for what the functions are doing. The hw should have had 3-4 easy examples with the pivot functions, so we could build up an intuition for what the functions do, before leading us to a harder problem. The hard problem was way too hard, and worst, it did not teach me ANYTHING. My guess is that, if you asked the class to do a very basic pivot_longer, at least half the class would struggle with the most basic version of pivot_longer. So the HW should have started with the easy versions of pivot_longer, before leading us to a much harder version. Overall, the first problem of the HW was VERY badly designed and did not effectively teach us how to use pivot_longer",2020-01-22 14:37:36
I would've liked more context for knowing how and why different distribution shapes matter.,2020-01-22 14:37:07
"I'm general, I understand things better when I actively engage with them in R.",2020-01-22 14:36:25
"The slides were well-designed and I loved the animations. However, I think the lecture could have been broken up into chunks and guiding questions that would have allowed some small group talk, which would have helped with understanding these more abstract concepts.",2020-01-22 14:36:11
"I think the class was a little too theoretical -- not because theory is bad, but because it wasn't really anchored by anything. I'm not sure what is important for me to know or not, or what the ""key points"" I should've taken away are. It was also a bit strange to think about these probabilities outside the context of hypotheses, for example. In any case, a more ""narrative"" lecture would've been helpful for me, personally.",2020-01-22 14:36:00
I liked that we did the analytic and the empirical solutions to the chess/basketball camp. I liked the way Tobi explained the difference between probability and likelihood. I had never understood this difference before. In some cases I would have liked him to explain in a little more detail what some of the code was doing.,2020-01-22 14:35:58
The content was very useful. I think it would have been more efficient if we would have gone through the RMarkdown file and ran the plots shown on the slide from there. Kind of like what we did  with visualization,2020-01-22 14:35:57
I enjoyed the visuals presented in today's class!,2020-01-22 14:35:42
"I wish that today's class had focused a bit more on the code, alongside the theory. Though ""in theory"" I now understand density plots and quantile-quantile plots, when I looked at all of the code in the R file I was completely unable to follow along. I'm afraid that I won't understand the material when I go over the notes later.",2020-01-22 14:35:38
"I liked seeing the plots produced using the different functions we learned about (e.g., qnorm, quantile). I would have found it helpful to spend some time manipulating these plots during class time, just to get a better sense of how they work. Thanks so much!",2020-01-22 14:35:36
"I would like to see, at the start, where these concepts we are learning will be used in the future. It is obvious that they are building blocks for useful skills we will learn. An example showcasing how these are used will better motivate the lecture.",2020-01-22 14:35:35
"I enjoyed the class overall! Sometimes I found it difficult to follow exactly what was going on in the R code, particularly in the more abstract sections. I plan to play around with the RMD, but it could also be useful to go over that in a bit more detail during lecture.",2020-01-22 14:35:34
I really liked the combination of r code and abstract examples in the class notes (without spending time going through actual r examples in class). it helped me feel like I could actually go and apply the material to my own work later this afternoon.,2020-01-22 14:35:32
Would like more time for questions and maybe self-twicking(?) the codes,2020-01-22 14:35:32
The code was well written out in such a way that facilitates private learning.,2020-01-22 14:35:32
"Today's lecture felt very abstract, especially during the second half – I think it would have been more helpful to have more examples (similar to the summer camp example). I'm also wondering how these basic concepts relate to regression and think it might be helpful to understand that more broadly",2020-01-22 14:35:31
Helpful tools for understanding your data,2020-01-22 14:35:29
"It'd be great if you can walk through the codes more thoroughly and slowly. Some of the codes had a few functions 
 or arguments that I was not familiar with.",2020-01-22 14:35:27
It was good to have a high-level review and have some of the R code explained in the way it was in the slides. Looking forward to getting some hands-on experience using the notebook.,2020-01-22 14:35:26
I like this class--the minor details that could make it better aren't even interesting enough to raise.,2020-01-22 14:35:26
"I thought some of the more challenging audience participation exercises sometimes feel like you're putting the room on the spot a bit. I still think they're good, but maybe giving a bit more time to think it over might be useful.",2020-01-22 14:35:25
I think adding in concrete examples whenever possible would be helpful. I found the basketball & chess camp example very helpful in understanding bayesian probability in practice.,2020-01-22 14:35:21
the difference between probability and likelihood is still unclear,2020-01-22 14:35:18
"good pace, would have liked to go over some more examples for distributions at the end",2020-01-22 14:35:17
I think working with the code while going through the plots would be useful practice.,2020-01-22 14:35:13
"Sometimes felt more separate from how it might be applicable in research than previous lectures, so it might have been nice to have more of a sense of when you want to use these features.",2020-01-22 14:35:12
It would have been nice to actually walk through an example from beginning to end. I think all of the examples were complete at the very beginning.,2020-01-22 14:35:10
It would be extra awesome if we did a simulation on the Monty Hall problem.,2020-01-22 14:35:09
"The description of density. Clearest explanation of it I've had to-date. Really liked ""seeing whats under the hood.""",2020-01-22 14:35:08
Would have liked more depth in probability distributions,2020-01-22 14:35:07
I think the class went a little fast. I got lost at the end. Maybe more examples and applications would be useful to understand these abstract topics,2020-01-22 14:35:05
really great class -- am realizing that my stats knowledge felt a bit lacking in understanding today's material; any suggestions on how i can work on that? thanks! :),2020-01-22 14:35:01
great!,2020-01-22 14:34:42
