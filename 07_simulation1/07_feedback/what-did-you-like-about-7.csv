"The class is okay. Right now it is difficult to map what's learn to what we will use it later. So hopefully for later classes, it will be okay. The major problem for me is that I was not able to make notes on the lecture notes. I understand that it is difficult to prepare notes several days in advance, but I hope you can at least post the notes 10 min before the class, so students can download it and make notes when attending the class",2019-01-23 11:51:55
"The causality examples at the beginning were really helpful (experiments 1, 2, and 3). I also thought that the walk through of the intuition for the analytic solution was really clear. For the sampling example, it was helpful when you showed what the output of the code/tables would look like/what each chunk of code is accomplishing (for me visuals are super helpful, like when you drew the tables)",2019-01-23 11:50:50
Overall I followed it well and felt good about where we left off. The one thing I would find useful is having definitions of some of the more obscure arguments in functions (such as Kernel) that we haven't seen before,2019-01-23 11:50:33
For midterm would like the 24hrs to have a weekend day Perhaps? Always have a lot of meetings and studies planned for weekday that is difficult to move to the weekend. Or could it be 48 hrs?,2019-01-23 11:50:15
Good job handling and taking the right pace on the student questions. Perhaps make a better motivation for using sampling? The basketball example could have been analyticially solved (which you do admit),2019-01-23 11:50:09
"My comment is about the homework. I am a bit concerned about how the questions were answered on piazza. I got most of my answers from stackoverflow and I felt very upset when I couldn't receive any hint on how  to fix the error in my code,  when I spent countless of hours on it.",2019-01-23 11:49:51
I reaallllyyy appreciate you all asking us about the homework and recognizing the time that was put into it. Thank you for asking those questions in the beginning and making this weeks homework more manageable. The slide numbers were helpful today.,2019-01-23 11:49:40
"For the midterm, I was wondering how many days we have to work on it. It seemed like it was only 24 hrs and over a weekday. I wonder if it might make more sense to extend this or give it over a weekend to allow people to work on it that may have other classes/exams/etc.",2019-01-23 11:49:32
It could be more interactive. We could get some time for brainstorming and pondering on a question with another student.,2019-01-23 11:49:22
"Today's class was much better than last time. The examples were easier to follow and the pace was right. I would recommend switching the order of how you present some materials. Specifically, it is difficult to be given a series of tools without understanding the ultimate goal of why we need them. I would recommend you start by really digging into why we need these tools and how we would be contained without them.",2019-01-23 11:49:15
"I appreciate the step-by-step nature of the slides today, at the concept and plot level. Could we do more little class check ins: ask us our intuitive expectations of the examples.",2019-01-23 11:49:12
"I  found hw2 to be super time consuming and difficult, which is making me pretty nervous about future assignments. As for the material covered today in class, I wish we stopped a bit longer at the code slides to delve step by step into what was going on.",2019-01-23 11:49:02
Good pace. Drawing parallel between theoretical and empirical. Feel like I always see them separate but it's good to see the connection.,2019-01-23 11:48:48
I think it would have been nice to have some interactive elements - looking at code without being able to run it and see what's its doing is kind of hard sometimes,2019-01-23 11:48:46
"Loved the ""understanding density()"" section. The animation really helped to visualize what the function does. Thanks for the lecture",2019-01-23 11:48:44
"I liked the concrete examples we worked through about calculating probabilities, as well as the symmetric functions we can use in R.",2019-01-23 11:48:42
Lecture was clear and helpful. Honestly I'm till a little confused about Bayesian networks stuff from last class (just throwing that in here in case that's useful info),2019-01-23 11:48:41
Just wondering when we should be simulating data. Is is appropriate to simulate data when the real data isn't normally distributed?,2019-01-23 11:48:40
"Demonstrations (e.g., density on slide 53) are really helpful. I can also tell this won't click at all until we test it out ourselves. So I'm hopeful that the homework will help us do that in a structured way.",2019-01-23 11:48:40
"We don't have a formal opportunity to provide feedback on HW, which is arguably very important!",2019-01-23 11:48:39
"still kind of lost as to why we do certain fundamental things--create samples, quantiles, etc.",2019-01-23 11:48:37
Intro activity felt a little bit like wasting time,2019-01-23 11:48:36
I liked the basketball and chess summer camp examples. I just wish there were more real-world examples like that throughout the lecture,2019-01-23 11:48:35
The example was great in understanding the material. More examples would be really helpful because some of these topics are highly conceptual.,2019-01-23 11:48:33
I enjoyed the very concrete examples and walking step-by-step through different methods to achieve answers.,2019-01-23 11:48:31
I thought pacing was really good today! Well done,2019-01-23 11:48:28
can you also take open ended feedback abt homework or course in general? like maybe an anonymous feedback form on the website or something,2019-01-23 11:48:28
Tobi is so amazing he could cut a hot knife with butter.,2019-01-23 11:48:22
found distributions at the beginning confusing. second half was more clear,2019-01-23 11:48:18
Very interesting!,2019-01-23 11:48:12
