What did you like about today's class? What could be improved next time?
Response
I like the penguins exercises!
"the audio was a bit muffled on zoom (I think because of masks + mic), but was able to hear most of it"
"The class was interesting but it wasn't clear what we were supposed to takeaway from the lecture. For example, are we expected to know how to do power analysis based on the lecture today?"
I found the practice problems most helpful!
"when you couldn't find the mouse, there was a moment that I caught a glimpse of it when you started shaking it. I think you had two screens going and the mouse pointer was on the other screen."
