Response
I wish we have more time to practice!
Everything was great :)
I want the latest r-markdown file that you showed us in the class to be shared that we can see the updated code from the original html.
Really appreciated the recap of last class! It's nice to get a refresher and to get to hear material twice.
Today's class felt less rushed than the last one which I appreciated. The slide animations were helpful for understanding density!
