"I liked the breakout room work. It really helped me get a sense of when to use the different functions. As someone with only a basic stats background, it took me a while to figure out that normal, gaussian, etc. are types of data whereas density, probability, quantile, and random are ways that we deal with the data. It would have been helpful to explain these terms at the beginning of lecture."
"A great class as usual! I think a bit more time in the breakout room would have been nice, as we got close to finishing but didn't quite make it."
It might have been nice to have gotten a more detailed explanation on the distribution models and functions
"i liked working on the penguin questions in a breakout room, but i felt a little frustrated that we didn't have enough time to get through much of it. i'd have appreciated more focus on the different types of probability distributions/more explanation of when to use each"
"good pace, i liked how we reviewed code line by line"
