"sometimes you use random stats words that you haven't explain which can make it a little difficult to follow what you're saying. Like today, you said ""gaussian nose"" but we haven't learned what that means so in order to understand what you're saying I have to try to figure out what that means. It would be great if you could give quick 1-sentence summaries of new terms"
do you have info on how long the midterm took students to complete last year?
Explanations were really good! Didn't quite understand the point of the breakout room
"As someone who does not remember learning ANOVA previously, I really enjoyed the perspective that ANOVA tells us how much of the variance is accounted for by the model (e.g. additional predictors) and the accompanying visualization that illustrates this point."
Im a little confused about where to use ANOVA and where to stick to t-tests etc
"just a general question - how many problem sets are there in this class? Will there be problem sets at the same time as final project assignments later in the quarter, or will problem sets phase out?"
"I feel like the explanations weren't that clear on some of the concepts. I'm not sure how I would improve them but I think it might've been going back and forth between  how the package does it, how to do it by hand that made it hard to understand the interpretation explanation."
