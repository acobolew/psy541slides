I want to learn more about why ANOVAs are evil. I think you covered this but for some reason I still feel unclear about why they're so bad.,2020-02-03 14:49:08
"I'd still love a slow, thorough breakdown of what each coefficient means in the ANOVA readout table.",2020-02-03 14:49:04
"I'm super happy with the structure of the class and that you are clear at the beginning and end what we are talking about and why. Also happy with the detailed looks ""under the hood"" of the tests, I feel it helps understanding. Perhaps a table or graph which more clearly outlines the different kind of tests and the different questions it answers is helpful, as long as it doesn't get to a ""cookbook""",2020-02-03 14:48:59
"I think there was more detailed explanation that I havent experienced in class before, and I found it helpful! The interactive exercise toward the end of the class was helpful too.",2020-02-03 14:48:56
"It sometimes confuses me when there is something the instructor doesn't know, but I'm looking forward to hear more about the questions next lecture! And I think for the competitions, it might make sense to show how to do sth. before doing the competition",2020-02-03 14:48:49
I think it would be really useful to explain or at least point us to a reference that explains how to do ANOVAs with unbalanced cell sizes,2020-02-03 14:48:47
I appreciated the comparisons to SPSS as a few of us are familiar with it. It may have been useful in earlier classes.,2020-02-03 14:48:47
Great class! Very clear explanation of how ANOVA works. I liked that we practiced how to tell if a certain effect is significant or if there is an interaction between two variables just by looking at the data visualization.,2020-02-03 14:48:46
"I felt like with some of the content, the key understanding was not put in the slides. Like the game with the bars. The explanation was verbal, and reviewing the slides will be less useful",2020-02-03 14:48:38
excellent,2020-02-03 14:48:37
"The past few classes have been incredibly helpful for thinking through the computations that underlie regression models and ANOVAs. I've encountered these in past courses, but I feel like I only now really understand what these tests are doing.",2020-02-03 14:48:34
"If the class examples are from real psych/social science research, it'd be easier to grasp the application of the functions that we learn.",2020-02-03 14:48:32
"I'd love to learn more about type I, II and III sums of squares. I've tried reading about them but I've found them difficult to understand. So I'd really appreciate it if we could delve into it a little bit.",2020-02-03 14:48:28
Really like going through the same visual representations of model a vs. model c and then code chunks in the presentation! It's very helpful and helps me make sense of it over a few classes. Also like the model comparison approach to stats,2020-02-03 14:48:24
Helpful but a little bit fast during the competition explanation.,2020-02-03 14:48:23
i would love to know the answer to the confidence interval/error bar question! I actually still dont really understand the difference between the two (are they the same thing??) Thank you!!,2020-02-03 14:48:23
I was shocked that I was so bad at guessing which effects were significant in the interaction plots!,2020-02-03 14:48:01
