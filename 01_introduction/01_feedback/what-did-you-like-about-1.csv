I thought the way the class was handled made it easy for me to relate. I know the work may be challenging but I'm quite optimistic about the class. Thanks!,2020-01-06 14:51:40
One improvement could be to allow for the TAs to handle some of the questions.,2020-01-06 14:51:38
"I liked that there will be plenty of support. Basically, that was made clear and also the general layout of the course. I look forward to learning how to analyze data at a higher level.",2020-01-06 14:51:28
"I thought that the general overview of the course schedule and expectations was clear and helpful. Next time, I think it could be helpful to briefly address examples of what kinds of things we'll be going over in the course (particularly examples of final project topics). Thanks!",2020-01-06 14:51:21
I liked that the expectations of the class were clearly explained and that the instructors are all very willing to help us learn the class material. I liked the idea of the Application sections. I liked the explanation about the growth mindset.,2020-01-06 14:51:13

"The professor and teaching staff are clearly enthusiastic (and enthusiasm is contagious - I'm excited too!). However, attending 2 sections per week seems like a lot. How much are the Thursday sections (application sections) recommended? Could those be discussed a little more during the next class?",2020-01-06 14:51:06

"Really helpful to understand the arc of the course. I'm eager to learn more about the specific statistical concepts we'll be learning, but I know those are available in the book and will be covered in classes to come. I'm also looking forward to seeing guidelines for and examples of final projects so that I can start brainstorming about possible ideas.",2020-01-06 14:50:53
Clear outline of the class. Good intro set up for the next lecture. I would like more information on the project scope and ideas to start thinking about it.,2020-01-06 14:50:43
I enjoyed the moments where we got to chat with the people sitting next to us. I think today's class provided a good beginning foundation for what the class will be.,2020-01-06 14:50:40

"I liked the way statistics and its importance/how cool it can be was discussed and introduced, especially addressing the fear that often surrounds this subject. No thoughts for improvement!",2020-01-06 14:50:20
