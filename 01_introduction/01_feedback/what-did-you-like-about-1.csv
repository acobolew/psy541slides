"I appreciate knowing expectations about the course. Humor was also helpful. Having a date for the midterm and more details about the final project will be helpful as I plan my quarter. Might be good to dive into some material, too, although I imagine that'll happen on Wednesday.",2019-01-07 11:39:29
Great introduction - I liked how it gave an overview of what to expect and the tools we will be using. Also like how Tobias was sensitive to different backgrounds and encouraged a growth mindset - helps it not be intimidating! Not sure about what can be improved since we didn't work with data/in R.,2019-01-07 11:39:15
I really appreciated that you gave an overview at the start of lecture of what we'll be covering and the important points. It's helpful to know what's important to focus on. On the same note (and maybe it's not so applicable to this lecture) it would be similarly helpful to wrap up at the end with the biggest takeaways.,2019-01-07 11:39:13
"Great overview of what we will be learning. You come across as super approachable and knowledgeable. I would have liked to know the length of the homework and the average amount of time you estimate us spending on: (a) homework, (b) readings + datacamp. Also, I loved citing sources and the thank you slide!",2019-01-07 11:38:47
It was informative. Next time it would be great if all deadlines for the midterm etc. would already be known by the first lecture. In terms of setup of the class I think 2 longer lectures rather than 3 short ones per week would be better (less switching costs etc),2019-01-07 11:38:28
Great enthusiasm and positivity : ),2019-01-07 11:38:27
"I would have liked to hear more from you on what you define to be 'good science.' For example, you alluded to replication, but beyond replication, what are some of your thoughts or philosophical orientation when it comes to conducting social science.",2019-01-07 11:38:24
"Everything was very clear, and I like a brief note on all the things we can do on R. Overall presentation style was friendly and welcoming, which makes for greater enjoyment and easier understanding of material.",2019-01-07 11:38:23
I liked the relaxed attitude. I'm excited about the focus on R. I do have a couple logistical questions left unanswerd,2019-01-07 11:38:19
"Tobi, you have such a wonderful presence in front of the class. Your enthusiasm is contagious. Admittedly, I have very little experience in statistics, and I was nervous about coming here today. But after this introductory session, I'm excited to pursue a growth mindset in statistics and to learn from you over the next 10 weeks. :)",2019-01-07 11:38:11
very clear. a little bit slow though but it was fine.,2019-01-07 11:38:08
"I will be happy to get started with R and its exercises! It was the first lecture, so it was slower than expected. But I like how you made the class expectation clear to students! But perhaps we can keep the first lecture shorter in length.",2019-01-07 11:38:05
Lecture felt very genuine - both in terms of excitement about the material and for teaching the class in a way that is helpful for all students,2019-01-07 11:38:03
I like the interactive part!,2019-01-07 11:38:03
"Thanks for providing lots info about course materials - various textbook recs, softwares",2019-01-07 11:38:02
"I liked having an overall structure of the course, so that I can get ready for the material. Thanks for a great first class! Very excited for the rest of the course :)",2019-01-07 11:38:00
"Good energy! I'm looking forward to future classes. Logistics are hard to make exciting, so I didn't expect a very exciting class.",2019-01-07 11:37:58
Like: comprehensive high-level picture about R and the structure of the course.,2019-01-07 11:37:57
"Your lecture style is engaging! Easy to follow , flow was good too. Excited for the rest of the quarter!",2019-01-07 11:37:55
Like: The planning. Nothing to point out yet.,2019-01-07 11:37:53
"Sometimes asking the class to raise hands (""Who's on piazza"") seems less effective because no one wants to raise hands.",2019-01-07 11:37:53
"liked that it addressed fear of statistics, justified the class structure (eg takehome midterm + final project instead of final exam)",2019-01-07 11:37:49
It was nice to meet our neighbors. I hope we keep having time and ways to meet others in class. It makes it easier to ask each other questions when the time comes. I like how many resources you list on the class website.,2019-01-07 11:37:46
Great job! -Ari,2019-01-07 11:37:45
