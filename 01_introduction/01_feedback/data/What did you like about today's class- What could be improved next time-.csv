What did you like about today's class? What could be improved next time?
Response
Good overview! It gave me confidence for the course without making it sound falsely easy :)
clear and descriptive about course expectations
Liked going through the structure and that Tobi spent time talking about his goals and philosophy for how to approach the course. Thanks for giving feedback from past students too. And I liked having the course pace
I like how everything is clearly laid out
I appreciated all the resources that were given and the transparency of what's expected and what to expect in the class.
was fun!
"I appreciated going through the different tools we'll use for this class, and making clear what is helpful for what. I also appreciated the expectation setting through showing past reviews."
I feel a little sad that we are being taught R at stats classes :(
"I liked all of itâ€”the lecture style, the slides, etc. I cant think of anything that could be improved at this point!"
Likes: Friendly demeanor. Posted slides beforehand.
The class goals and expectations were set clearly
"I think it was great! Maybe would add: candidate strategies for approaching the class depending on a) overall coding experience, b) r experience, c) stats experience, etc"
Great meeting everyone!
I liked how friendly and welcoming you were! I'm not a psych student and don't feel out of place at all.
"Excited to get started. I appreciated the real world examples, would love to keep that throughout the class. Sometimes area-specific examples are hard to relate to"
Seemed good!
A nice intro
nothing
I think it's great to get a comprehensive overview of class content and also to get clarification about when and where to ask questions etc. Thanks!
