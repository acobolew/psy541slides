What did you like about today's class? What could be improved next time?
Response
Not particularly too fast but just a lot of information. To listen to and on some of the slides
"nice intro, love growth mindset talk (maybe do a bit more next time) and talk about inclusivity!"
"Good pace, nice examples and illustrations, good understanding of goals, objectives and teaching approach etc."
"It made me feel a lot more prepared and comfortable taking this course, despite being a little intimidated! Also appreciated Tobi describing DataCamp not only as a resource, but also as a company."
"I liked the inclusion of skills past students gained/were interested in, and feedback from them"
Add slide numbers please
Very well organized. Everything was great!
Really looking forward to the class!
"I liked class today! Felt just a bit slow to me, but learned a lot and it felt applicable :)"
"excited for the quarter, Tobi!"
covered all the points that we could have questions about
it was great :)
I liked the openness and transparency about the difficulty of the class as well as the bit about DataCamp
Slides compliment presentation great.
"session was engaging, I appreciated the stretch break"
I liked how personal it felt -- the music made it feel real and I can tell it's going to be a fun quarter based on the way the class was described.
very thoughtful and professional! Definitely looking forward to this course!
Professor Gerstenberg is a superb instructor! I can tell this is going to be a great class!!! :)
