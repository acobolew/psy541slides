"Really impressed with the slides! The stretch break was great and I appreciate the music to set the vibes in the class. Although it was fine since I didn't need (I think) to take notes this time, the pace felt a little fast for if we were reviewing concepts."
Liked having a defined break! Hope that continues :)
Love starting class with new music. Great intro to class lecture didn't feel like I'm missing any info and I know class expectations. No improvements necessary
Tobi is nice! I like how he talks
"music, break , flow of class"
"Love the transparency about anonymous feedback collection, the one minute stretch, and the acknowledge on Data camp."
I liked the level of detail that you went into when explaining things! The class seems very friendly and definitely not as intimidating as I thought it would be
"I liked the culture setting slide and wished it was introduced earlier, at the beginning of the class. It also helps to start each class with a culture setting slide (e.g., on collaborative learning and growth, emphasizing progress over ""perfect"" codes)."
Very friendly and inviting to a new class at the start of a new quarter that's all online -.-
"i liked the breakout groups and getting to talk to new people, as well as hearing more about the teaching team."
I really enjoyed today's class. It put to ease some of my nerves around taking stats :)
The stretch break :)
the introduction to the importance of R is really clear!
