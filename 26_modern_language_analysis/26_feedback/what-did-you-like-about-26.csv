"Thanks for providing the guest lecture, especially in such an environment wherein interaction is limited and your get very little additional feedback. You may have done this and I missed it, but it would be good to organize the lecture around central questions- then review those questions once a certain chunk is done (after pausing for a few seconds to give participants time to try to answer for themselves). Loved your energy and examples.",2020-03-11 15:02:25
"The content of the class was interesting, however, I think that some concepts could have been explained better. In addition, I didn't like that the course that it's being offered in the Fall  was publicized so much. It was good that it was mentioned at the beginning, but there is no need to repeat that so many times.",2020-03-11 14:59:18

"Super interesting but I wish the time management was better. I was looking forward to the machine learning and bottom-up part, and that was rushed through.",2020-03-11 14:57:56
