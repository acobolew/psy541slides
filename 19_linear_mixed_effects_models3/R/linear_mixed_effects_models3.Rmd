# load sleepstudy data set 
df.sleep = sleepstudy %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(subject = as.character(subject)) %>% 
  select(subject, days, reaction)

# add two fake participants (with missing data)
df.sleep = df.sleep %>% 
  bind_rows(tibble(subject = "374",
                   days = 0:1,
                   reaction = c(286, 288)),
            tibble(subject = "373",

  mutate(id = rep(1:24, 2)) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = t1:t3,
               names_to = "timepoint",
               values_to = "score") %>% 
  arrange(id)
```

### Politness data 

```{r}
df.politeness = read_csv("data/politeness_data.csv") %>% 
  mutate(scenario = as.factor(scenario))
```

## Understanding the lmer() syntax 

Here is an overview of how to specify different kinds of linear mixed effects models.

```{r, echo=F}
tibble(formula = c("`dv ~ x1 + (1 | g)`",
                   "`dv ~ x1 + (0 + x1 | g)`",
                   "`dv ~ x1 + (x1 | g)`",
                   "`dv ~ x1 + (x1 || g)`",
                   "`dv ~ x1 + (1 | school) + (1 | teacher)`",
                   "`dv ~ x1 + (1 | school/teacher)`"),
       description = c("Random intercept for each level of `g`",
                       "Random slope for each level of `g`",
                       "Correlated random slope and intercept for each level of `g`",
                       "Uncorrelated random slope and intercept for each level of `g`",
                       "Random intercept for each level of `school` and for each level of `teacher` (crossed)",
                       "Random intercept for each level of `school` and for each level of `teacher` in `school` (nested)")) %>% 
  kable()
```

Note that this `(1 | school/teacher)` is equivalent to `(1 | school) + (1 | teacher:school)` (see [here](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/228800/crossed-vs-nested-random-effects-how-do-they-differ-and-how-are-they-specified)). 

## ANOVA vs. Lmer 

### Between subjects ANOVA 

Let's start with a between subjects ANOVA (which means we are in `lm()` world). We'll take a look whether what type of `instruction` participants received made a difference to their `response`. 

First, we use the `aov_ez()` function from the "afex" package to do so. 

```{r}
aov_ez(id = "id",
       dv = "response",
       between = "instruction",
       data = df.reasoning)
```

Looks like there was no main effect of `instruction` on participants' responses. 

An alternative route for getting at the same test, would be via combining `lm()` with `Anova()` (as we've done before in class). 

```{r}
lm(formula = response ~ instruction,
   data = df.reasoning %>% 
     group_by(id, instruction) %>% 
     summarize(response = mean(response)) %>% 
     ungroup()) %>% 
  joint_tests()
```

The two routes yield the same result. Notice that for the `lm()` approach, I calculated the means for each participant in each condition first (using `group_by()` and `summarize()`). 

### Repeated-measures ANOVA 

Now let's take a look whether `validity` and `plausibility` affected participants' responses in the reasoning task. These two factors were varied within participants. Again, we'll use the `aov_ez()` function like so: 

```{r}
aov_ez(id = "id",
       dv = "response",
       within = c("validity", "plausibility"),
       data = df.reasoning %>% 
         filter(instruction == "probabilistic"))
```

For the linear model route, given that we have repeated observations from the same participants, we need to use `lmer()`. The repeated measures anova has the random effect structure as shown below: 

```{r}
lmer(formula = response ~ validity * plausibility + (1 | id) + (1 | validity:id) + (1 | plausibility:id),
     data = df.reasoning %>% 
        filter(instruction == "probabilistic") %>%
        group_by(id, validity, plausibility) %>%
        summarize(response = mean(response))) %>% 
  joint_tests()
```

Again, we get a similar result using the `joint_tests()` function. 

Note though that the results of the ANOVA route and the `lmer()` route weren't identical here (although they were very close). For more information as to why this happens, see [this post](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/117660/what-is-the-lme4lmer-equivalent-of-a-three-way-repeated-measures-anova).

### Mixed ANOVA 

Now let's take a look at both between- as well as within-subjects factors. Let's compare the `aov_ez()` route

```{r}
aov_ez(id = "id",
       dv = "response",
       between = "instruction",
       within = c("validity", "plausibility"),
       data = df.reasoning)
```

with the `lmer()` route: 

```{r}
lmer(formula = response ~ instruction * validity * plausibility + (1 | id) + (1 | validity:id) + (1 | plausibility:id),
      data = df.reasoning %>%
        group_by(id, validity, plausibility, instruction) %>%
        summarize(response = mean(response))) %>% 
  joint_tests()
```
Here, both routes yield the same results. 

## Follow-up tests with emmeans

Just like with the linear model `lm()`, we can use linear contrasts to test more specific hypotheses with `lmer()`. The `emmeans()` function from the `emmeans` package will be our friend. 

### Sleep study 

Let's ask some more specific question aboust the sleep study. 

1. Do reaction times differ between day 0 and the first day of sleep deprivation? 
2. Do reaction times differ between the first and the second half of the study? 

Let's visualize the data first: 

```{r}
ggplot(data = df.sleep %>% 
         mutate(days = as.factor(days)),
       mapping = aes(x = days,
                     y = reaction)) + 
  geom_point(position = position_jitter(width = 0.1),
             alpha = 0.1) + 
  stat_summary(fun.data = "mean_cl_boot")
```

And now let's fit the model, and compute the contrasts: 

```{r}
fit = mixed(formula = reaction ~ 1 + days + (1 | subject),
           data = df.sleep %>% 
             mutate(days = as.factor(days)))

contrast = list(first_vs_second = c(-1, 1, rep(0, 8)),
                early_vs_late = c(rep(-1, 5)/5, rep(1, 5)/5))

fit %>% 
  emmeans(specs = "days",
          contr = contrast) %>% 
  pluck("contrasts")

df.sleep %>% 
  filter(days %in% c(0, 1)) %>% 
  group_by(days) %>% 
  summarize(reaction = mean(reaction))

df.sleep %>% 
  mutate(index = ifelse(days %in% 0:4, "early", "late")) %>% 
  group_by(index) %>% 
  summarize(reaction = mean(reaction))
```

### Weight loss study 

For the weight loss data set, we want to check: 

1. Whether there was a difference between the first two vs. the last time point. 
2. Whether there was a linear trend across the time points. 

Let's first visualize again: 

```{r}
ggplot(data = df.weightloss,
       mapping = aes(x = timepoint,
                     y = score,
                     group = diet,
                     color = diet)) + 
  geom_point(position = position_jitterdodge(dodge.width = 0.5,
                                  jitter.width = 0.1,
                                  jitter.height = 0),
             alpha = 0.1) + 
  stat_summary(fun.data = "mean_cl_boot",
               position = position_dodge(width = 0.5)) +
  facet_wrap(~ exercises) + 
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1")

ggplot(data = df.weightloss,
       mapping = aes(x = timepoint,
                     y = score)) + 
  geom_point(position = position_jitter(width = 0.1),
             alpha = 0.1) + 
  stat_summary(fun.data = "mean_cl_boot") +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1")
```
And then fit the model, and compute the contrasts:

```{r}
fit = aov_ez(id = "id",
       dv = "score",
       between = "exercises",
       within = c("diet", "timepoint"),
       data = df.weightloss)

contrasts = list(first_two_vs_last = c(-0.5, -0.5, 1),
                 linear_increase = c(-1, 0, 1))

fit %>% 
  emmeans(spec = "timepoint",
          contr = contrasts)
```

Because we only had one observation in each cell of our design, the ANOVA was appropriate here (no data points needed to be aggregated). 

Both contrasts are significant. 

### Politeness study 

For the politeness study, we'll be interested in one particular contrast: 

1. Was there an effect of attitude on frequency for female participants? 

Let's visualize first: 

```{r}
# overview of the data 
ggplot(data = df.politeness,
        mapping = aes(x = attitude,
                      y = frequency,
                      group = gender,
                      color = gender)) + 
  geom_point(position = position_jitter(width = 0.1),
             alpha = 0.1) + 
  stat_summary(fun.data = "mean_cl_boot") + 
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1")

# variation across scenarios 
ggplot(data = df.politeness,
        mapping = aes(x = scenario,
                      y = frequency)) + 
  geom_point(position = position_jitter(width = 0.1),
             alpha = 0.1) + 
  stat_summary(fun.data = "mean_cl_boot") + 
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1")

# variation across participants
ggplot(data = df.politeness,
        mapping = aes(x = subject,
                      y = frequency)) + 
  geom_point(position = position_jitter(width = 0.1),
             alpha = 0.1) + 
  stat_summary(fun.data = "mean_cl_boot") + 
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1")
```

We fit the model and compute the contrasts. 

```{r, message=FALSE}
fit = lmer(formula = frequency ~ 1 + attitude * gender + (1 | subject) + (1 | scenario),
           data = df.politeness)

fit %>% 
  emmeans(specs = pairwise ~ attitude + gender,
          adjust = "none")
```

Here, I've computed all pairwise contrasts. We were only interested in one: `inf F - pol F` and that one is significant. So the frequency of female participants' pitch differed between the informal and polite condition. 

If we had used an ANOVA approach for this data set, we could have done it like so: 

```{r}
aov_ez(id = "subject",
       dv = "frequency",
       between = "gender",
       within = "attitude",
       data = df.politeness)
```

This approach ignores the variation across scenarios (and just computed the mean instead). Arguably, the `lmer()` approach is better here as it takes all of the data into account. 

## Mixtures of participants 

What if we have groups of participants who differ from each other? Let's generate data for which this is the case.

```{r}
# make example reproducible 
set.seed(1)

sample_size = 20
b0 = 1
b1 = 2
sd_residual = 0.5
sd_participant = 0.5
mean_group1 = 1
mean_group2 = 10

df.mixed = tibble(
  condition = rep(0:1, each = sample_size), 
  participant = rep(1:sample_size, 2)) %>% 
  group_by(participant) %>% 
  mutate(group = sample(1:2, size = 1),
         intercept = ifelse(group == 1,
                            rnorm(n(), mean = mean_group1, sd = sd_participant),
                            rnorm(n(), mean = mean_group2, sd = sd_participant))) %>% 
  group_by(condition) %>% 
  mutate(value = b0 + b1 * condition + intercept + rnorm(n(), sd = sd_residual)) %>% 
  ungroup %>% 
  mutate(condition = as.factor(condition),
         participant = as.factor(participant))
```

#### Ignoring mixture

Let' first fit a model that ignores the fact that there are two different groups of participants. 

```{r}
# fit model
fit.mixed = lmer(formula = value ~ 1 + condition + (1 | participant),
                 data = df.mixed)

summary(fit.mixed)
```

Let's look at the model's predictions: 

```{r}
fit.mixed %>%
  augment() %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  ggplot(data = .,
         mapping = aes(x = condition,
                       y = value,
                       group = participant)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_line(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_point(aes(y = fitted),
             color = "red") +
  geom_line(aes(y = fitted),
             color = "red")
```


And let's simulate some data from the fitted model: 

```{r}
# simulated data 
fit.mixed %>%
  simulate() %>%
  bind_cols(df.mixed) %>%
  ggplot(data = .,
         mapping = aes(x = condition,
                       y = sim_1,
                       group = participant)) +
  geom_line(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5)
```

As we can see, the simulated data doesn't look like the data that was used to fit the model.  

#### Modeling mixture

Now, let's fit a model that takes the differences between groups into account by adding a fixed effect for `group`.

```{r}
# fit model
fit.grouped = lmer(formula = value ~ 1 + group + condition + (1 | participant),
                   data = df.mixed)

summary(fit.grouped)
```

Note how the variance of the random intercepts is much smaller now that we've taken the group structure in the data into account. 

Let's visualize the model's predictions:

```{r}
fit.grouped %>%
  augment() %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  ggplot(data = .,
         mapping = aes(x = condition,
                       y = value,
                       group = participant)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_line(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_point(aes(y = fitted),
             color = "red") +
  geom_line(aes(y = fitted),
             color = "red")
```

And simulate some data from the model: 

```{r}
# simulated data 
fit.grouped %>%
  simulate() %>%
  bind_cols(df.mixed) %>%
  ggplot(data = .,
         mapping = aes(x = condition,
                       y = sim_1,
                       group = participant)) +
  geom_line(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5)
```

This time, the simulated data looks much more like the data that was used to fit the model. Yay! 


```{r}
ggpredict(model = fit.grouped,
          terms = "condition") %>% 
  plot()

ggpredict(model = fit.mixed,
          terms = "condition") %>% 
  plot()
```


#### Heterogeneity in variance

The example above has shown that we can take overall differences between groups into account by adding a fixed effect. Can we also deal with heterogeneity in variance between groups? For example, what if the responses of one group exhibit much more variance than the responses of another group? 

Let's first generate some data with heterogeneous variance: 

```{r}
# make example reproducible 
set.seed(1)

sample_size = 20
b0 = 1
b1 = 2
sd_residual = 0.5
mean_group1 = 1
sd_group1 = 1
mean_group2 = 30
sd_group2 = 10

df.variance = tibble(
  condition = rep(0:1, each = sample_size), 
  participant = rep(1:sample_size, 2)) %>% 
  group_by(participant) %>% 
  mutate(group = sample(1:2, size = 1),
         intercept = ifelse(group == 1,
                            rnorm(n(), mean = mean_group1, sd = sd_group1),
                            rnorm(n(), mean = mean_group2, sd = sd_group2))) %>% 
  group_by(condition) %>% 
  mutate(value = b0 + b1 * condition + intercept + rnorm(n(), sd = sd_residual)) %>% 
  ungroup %>% 
  mutate(condition = as.factor(condition),
         participant = as.factor(participant))
```

Let's fit the model: 

```{r}
# fit model
fit.variance = lmer(formula = value ~ 1 + group + condition + (1 | participant),
                    data = df.variance)

summary(fit.variance)
```

Look at the data and model predictions: 

```{r}
fit.variance %>%
  augment() %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  ggplot(data = .,
         mapping = aes(x = condition,
                       y = value,
                       group = participant)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_line(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_point(aes(y = fitted),
             color = "red") +
  geom_line(aes(y = fitted),
             color = "red")
```

And the simulated data: 

```{r}
# simulated data 
fit.variance %>%
  simulate() %>%
  bind_cols(df.mixed) %>%
  ggplot(data = .,
         mapping = aes(x = condition,
                       y = sim_1,
                       group = participant)) +
  geom_line(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5)
```

The `lmer()` fails here. It uses one normal distribution to model the variance between participants. It cannot account for the fact that the answers of one group of participants vary more than the answers from another groups of participants. Again, the simulated data doesn't look like the original data, even though we did take the grouping into account. 

We will later see that it's straightforward in Bayesian models to explicitly model heterogeneity in variance. 

## Bootstrapping 

Bootstrapping is a good way to estimate our uncertainty on the parameter estimates in the model. 

### Linear model 

Let's briefly review how to do bootstrapping in a simple linear model. 

```{r}
# fit model 
fit.lm = lm(formula = reaction ~ 1 + days,
            data = df.sleep)

# coefficients
coef(fit.lm)

# bootstrapping 
df.boot = df.sleep %>% 
  bootstrap(n = 100,
            id = "id") %>% 
  mutate(fit = map(.x = strap,
                   .f = ~ lm(formula = reaction ~ 1 + days, data = .)),
         tidy = map(.x = fit, 
                    .f = tidy)) %>% 
  unnest(tidy) %>% 
  select(id, term, estimate) %>% 
  spread(term, estimate) %>% 
  clean_names() 
```

Let's illustrate the linear model with a confidence interval (making parametric assumptions using the t-distribution). 

```{r, message=FALSE}
ggplot(data = df.sleep,
       mapping = aes(x = days, y = reaction)) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3)
```

And let's compare this with the different regression lines that we get out of our bootstrapped samples:

```{r}
ggplot(data = df.sleep,
       mapping = aes(x = days,
                     y = reaction)) + 
  geom_abline(data = df.boot,
              aes(intercept = intercept,
                  slope = days,
                  group = id),
              alpha = 0.1) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3)
```

#### bootmer() function

For the linear mixed effects model, we can use the `bootmer()` function to do bootstrapping. 

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
set.seed(1)

# fit the model 
fit.lmer = lmer(formula = reaction ~ 1 + days + (1 + days | subject),
                data = df.sleep)

# bootstrap parameter estimates 
boot.lmer = bootMer(fit.lmer,
                    FUN = fixef,
                    nsim = 100)

# compute confidence interval 
boot.ci(boot.lmer, index = 2, type = "perc")
