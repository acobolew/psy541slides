"I thought today's class was great, and had a great balance of conceptual stuff and exploring the R. I think I'm still a bit confused on how and why the contrasts are defined -- what are strategies for selecting the right contrasts?"
"As someone new to a lot of theories, I thought this gave a good introduction and motivation for the use of contrasts and power analyses. There was a lot of information to wrap my head around and, I think doing the pwr analysis together in r would have been really helpful; though I understanding it's difficult to do with the limited time"
Today's class seemed a little rushed and I felt lost towards the end. There was too much content and Im worried because most of it will be on the midterm as well now
i pray that we don't have to implement any new functions that we haven't already in the hw
