"In general, the class was good. However, there were several concepts that were not clearly explained. For example, what is the difference between p value and alpha? Can you write it in a probability formula to explain the differences? Also, for the contrasts in R, may be it is good to know the meaning of estimated marginal means? Are they different from calculating the mean for a particular group? Finally, part of the codes about contrasts are not in the lecture note.",2019-02-08 11:54:06
What other methods are there for driving effect size between groups other than Cohen's do?,2019-02-08 11:52:42
"So sorry for yawning ^^;... I had a 7am remote presentation and haven't been sleeping much, it definitely wasn't due to class being boring. I really enjoy these lectures and how you talk through both the theory behind these tests as well as the code.",2019-02-08 11:52:20
Today's class was the perfect speed. Thank you for showing us similar examples as past classes. It helped me follow the lecture more closely.,2019-02-08 11:52:02
"First time learning power analysis in a systematic way, thank you!!! We will get the R code on how to run a power analysis in future class, right?",2019-02-08 11:52:00
"To counter my classmates, if there's no opportunity to ask questions then if you get lost, it's very hard to catch back up. The rest of the lecture would then become very hard to follow.",2019-02-08 11:51:26
