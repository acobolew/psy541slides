What did you like about today's class? What could be improved next time?
Response
I'm excited we're finally getting to modeling!
"Thank you for making the class hybrid! I know it's more work for you, but I really appreciate it!"
Really enjoyed this class! Clear explanation for confidence interval and bootstrapping. Thank you!
"please release the homework before the classes that will review the material (right now it's released after the classes that contain the relevant material), this allows us to have a framework for applying the material. Thank you!"
Really good explanations of some things I had learned before but didn't fully understand.
I'm still confused about the advantages of bootstrapping.
"I very much appreciate the review of prior materials at the beginning of the class. Could you please walk through code more slowly. I am not sure why and when we use ""{"""
"I really like the framing in terms of model comparison; this feels like a much more extensible kind of thinking! Also, I just generally wanted to say that I really appreciate how much you incorporate student feedback to adaptively guide your teaching approach; thank you!"
Could you review bootstrapping once more at the beginning of next class? Or could we have time in groups/breakout rooms to work through a quick example of bootstrapping?
