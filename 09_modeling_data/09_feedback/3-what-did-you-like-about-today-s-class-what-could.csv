I appreciated Tobi's explanation of the F-test and one-sample t-test! Didn't realized that they are connected that way before.
I'm finding myself getting a bit lost when we get into the nuisances and inner workings of the formulas; sometimes it's hard to differentiate between the details and what are the big picture takeaways
"I'mma little confused about what the goal of this class is. If it's to teach the math behind these statistical tests or just how to code them. If we're supposed to be learning the actual math then I feel like you need to go in to real examples instead of switching over to the code. If it's just to learn the code, then I think it would be more useful to spend more time learning about the code side. This split is a little confusing and makes it harder to follow along"
Great explanations for the different stats components. I would like for the breakout rooms to be brought back if possible
