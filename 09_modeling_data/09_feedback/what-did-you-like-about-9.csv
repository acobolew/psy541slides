Your explanation was very clear and well thought out; however the level of interaction was low. It may have been better to let us struggle with a few of these concepts with each other from time to time to increase the level of interaction and  foreground questions.,2020-01-27 14:52:11
"I didn't fully understand the utility of the f statistic. I like the simple heuristic of modeling as a process of increasing accuracy while minimizing complexity, but I didn't fully understand why it's important to minimize complexity. A short explanation might fix things for me.",2020-01-27 14:51:19
I liked the wraparound way of getting to a t-test...too often I just assume I know what it's doing and I don't. But I found it difficult to understand this interpretation of an F statistic,2020-01-27 14:50:49
I really liked this class. I really liked the general procedure that Tobi explained.,2020-01-27 14:50:30
Hope we cover degrees of freedom.,2020-01-27 14:49:52
I found the modeling-based approach very intuitive and I think it helped me understand the conceptual basis of statistical testing more so than other classes I've taken. Thanks.,2020-01-27 14:49:50
"I liked that you included poll questions every few slides, to keep us engaged! That said, the last two poll questions were very confusing and made it clear to me that I did not really understand the material....",2020-01-27 14:49:44
I like how we build up from the basic blocks. maybe talk about how the central limit theorem is a good approximation for i.i.d observations??,2020-01-27 14:49:42
Love how scaffolded the lessons were. Clearest statistics lecture to date.,2020-01-27 14:49:41
"Today's class was very informative, but I think it would have been helpful to see the simulations (such as the one described at the end of the lecture) done in class.",2020-01-27 14:49:40
Really enjoyed the thorough explanations. Thank you!,2020-01-27 14:49:39
I think the lecture is still too theoretical with not enough concrete examples....it makes it hard to follow.,2020-01-27 14:49:35
This was a really intuitive way of thinking about statistical tests that I hadn't considered before :),2020-01-27 14:49:29
Appreciate the detail.,2020-01-27 14:49:28
