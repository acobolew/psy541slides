What did you like about today's class? What could be improved next time?
Response
I won't know if I understand until I try it myself!
I feel like I get logistic regressions!
I really felt like I understood theoretically bayes today in the first half of the new content but got lost in the posterior distribution conversation from Greta on
I think it's great to learn about Bayesian data analysis! I wish we'd devote more time to it this quarter!
