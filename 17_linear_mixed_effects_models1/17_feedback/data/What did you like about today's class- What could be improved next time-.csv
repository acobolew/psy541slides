What did you like about today's class? What could be improved next time?
Response
can we get a homework on what today's lectures covered? I learn a lot when I apply the concepts to solve a problem
I appreciated the explanation! It feels good to be learning :)
"Would be nice to look at more concrete examples! But conceptually, it's a nice introduction! Thanks Tobi!"
Your slides are awesome! They're great for both following in class and referencing afterwards!
It would be nice to move a little faster.
