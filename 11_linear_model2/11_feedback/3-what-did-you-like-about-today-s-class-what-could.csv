Response
"I found the breakout room exercise example that included suicide to be quite triggering, particularly given the ""light-hearted"" nature of the exercise and thus framing mental health as something that is not serious or something to ""joke"" about. Particularly given the tight coupling of students who struggle with mental health in university settings, I would recommend removing that example in future iterations of the class/exercise."
The slides were very informative! Practical exercises please :)
Tobi's explanation of how to interpret results from r was really clear to me. I appreciate it very much!
"Thanks for addressing the data used in last class in a sensitive, timely manner. I really appreciate that you review these comments and integrate them into how you structure the class--it's hard to feel listened to right now and so, thank you."
The correlation vs. causation activity was hilarious.
I really enjoyed today's lecture and appreciate being made aware of how the tools I use to run analyses work in the first place.
Thank  you Tobi for taking course feedback seriously and responded to any issues brought up by the students.
"i liked having a short discussion about multiple regression, it helped to clarify why we do the things we do in stats and get at the bigger picture. i was wondering if it would be possible to have a stretch break earlier in the class? 2:10 always feels very far away"
"Really enjoyed how we built off of the same example one concept at a time, made learning the different concepts very digestable"
The 5-min breakout room was fun.
