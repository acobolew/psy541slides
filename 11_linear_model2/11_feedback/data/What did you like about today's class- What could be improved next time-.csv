The correlation champion game was fun!
"You sped through explaining how to interpret and present the statistics on a research paper. Perhaps if you could give a more in-depth explaining or a recap of it, and also why you chose to show a particular statistics as opposed to others generated by R.

This portion is extremely important for us. Thank you!"
