What did you like about today's class? What could be improved next time?
Response
I liked hearing other classmates' questions. I also liked that the code was shown and explained.
Thank you for reviewing content from last class. That was very helpful and much needed.
Thanks for putting time into making your slides and explanations so organized all quarter long!
The cartoon is pretty cute!
