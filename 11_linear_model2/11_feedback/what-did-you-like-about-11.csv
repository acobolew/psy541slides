I think today's class is super helpful. It explains a lot about complex models that give different predictions conditioning on some predictors (student = 1/ = 0),2019-02-01 11:52:05
Thanks for helping us visualize what is happening behind the hood with multiple regressions. I found it very helpful. It would be nice to have some more interactive moments with questions or games like last time,2019-02-01 11:50:22
"I liked how we walked through each step of building a linear model. I would perhaps avoid using the whiteboard on the left side of the classroom, or at least narrate everything you're writing, because I'm not sure if everyone in the classroom can see it (it's a weird angle).",2019-02-01 11:50:21
"Really good and helpful today to continue to connect our process/procedure to regressions and things I'm more familiar with (interactions, main effects, etc.). Still a little confused about the +1 and -1 mean and intercept concepts, though.",2019-02-01 11:50:15
Super helpful class! Things are really making sense. Thank you!,2019-02-01 11:50:14
Would you also cover the nesting concept as well. For example with 3 levels. I haven't been able to find any good resources to learn it properly.,2019-02-01 11:49:56
"Class was good. Would appreciate a list of ways in which we might misinterpret importance of regression, as well as why we should care.",2019-02-01 11:49:42
the flow was really good - building on the equations made it easy to understand. thank you! :),2019-02-01 11:49:42
Looking forward to exploring the Judd text you reference.,2019-02-01 11:49:40
I love this new model comparison approach! Thank you for this super helpful and flexible framework.,2019-02-01 11:49:31
It was great:),2019-02-01 11:49:26
Today's class was great. I really enjoyed the way you recapped the general procedure from last class. Null Hypothesis Testing is much clearer for me. Thank you!,2019-01-30 19:09:53
