"Today's class was VERY conceptual. It would be rally helpful to see some more applied examples. How do you determine the relationship between variables? These examples already have those relationships mapped out for us, but what if it's not clear? Additionally, if you used more ""real-life"" examples, it would really help us follow along in the code what the numbers really mean/represent. Also, it seems like we're constantly running out of time when there are so many questions. It would be great if we could maybe have more room for questions worked in to the lectures so we don't have to cram a lot of information in to the end of class."
I would have liked this explanation on controlling variables before the midterm in which we were asked to do that was due.
