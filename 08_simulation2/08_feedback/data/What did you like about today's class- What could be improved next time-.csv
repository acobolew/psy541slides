please continue to review key concepts from prior lectures at the beginning of the lecture
"This may just be a reminder, if we get lost we ask less or no questions, so more questions are indicative of a good pace (and waiting in silence during q breaks is good so we can catch up)."
thank you for illustrating the concept by giving the example. Getting this intuition is very valuable.
"The illustrative examples continue to be elucidating and great. It's definitely been a lot easier for me to understand the concepts with these examples, and the short recaps are really good"
the pace was great and the explanations were super clear :)
This is the clearest time I learned p-value. Thank you!
would like to have left some time in the end to hear students' questions.
The animations and explanations of stats concepts are very helpful.
