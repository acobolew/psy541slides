"Toni, your explanation of p-values was the most sensical explanation I have ever heard."
I find it a little difficult to go back and forth between the R code and the concept. Not sure if it's possible but if we could finish a review of the concept and then go over the R code related to that concept it'd help me out I think
The pace was great and I really appreciated how much detail you went into about p-values and CIs. These concepts have never been super clear to me and this lecture really helped
I liked the memes - very fun!
"really appreciated the code for how to do permutations and bootstraps. Really excited to learn about the pull function, so I don't have to use base R indexes to pull things out."
