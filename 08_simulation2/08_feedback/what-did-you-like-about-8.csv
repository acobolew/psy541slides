"Good class! It was helpful to have the code on the slides to go back to later, and illustrating the differences between the population, sampling distribution and sample.",2019-01-25 12:27:53
"The visuals for today's lectures were really helpful! (e.g.,  the tables for sampling multiple times) I wonder if it would have been useful to go over some of this before bayesian inference but I'm not sure..",2019-01-25 11:52:31
Really appreciated the logical presentation of ideas. It seems like we consistently cover a little less than expected during class. Thanks for engaging our questions!,2019-01-25 11:52:28
I quite like the integration of R code in the slides. I find it useful to have a concrete implementation of formalisms.,2019-01-25 11:52:24
I really liked the visualizations and simulations of the procedures that generate p-values and confidence intervals.,2019-01-25 11:52:15
I like the lecture. I do find your explanation about centra limit theorem is very intuitive and easy to understand. Great job and thanks for an interesting lecture!,2019-01-25 11:52:14
"The pace was much better. The simulation website for central limit theorem was really helpful. I'm still not positive how that helps us tons with sampling distribution, but I'll work on figuring that out.",2019-01-25 11:52:02
Central limit theorem was a little bit confusing......,2019-01-25 11:52:02
Good explanation. I haven't really understood the CLT before,2019-01-25 11:51:58
"That was a great explanation of the p values and CI, particularly liked the visuals and the Brown website that demonstrated it in real time.",2019-01-25 11:51:57
the animated stats simulations were really helpful! Thank you :),2019-01-25 11:51:48
I think you spent too long on CLT which isn't intuitively difficult and would like more time on the harder topics near the end,2019-01-25 11:51:41
