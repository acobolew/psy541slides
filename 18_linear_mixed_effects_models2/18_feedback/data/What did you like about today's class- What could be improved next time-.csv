What did you like about today's class? What could be improved next time?
Response
"I appreciate the structure of the class: recap and walk-through of new learning material. Looking forward to learning more about linear effect model. It would be great to have a ""cheat sheet"" about the assumptions of each of the different model tests and what each tests"
The use of that website was really helpful to visualize what mixed effects model actually do!
Thanks for taking the time to answer all our questions! And being flexible with how much of the lecture you cover.
I'd like to see more examples. I like the one in the beginning about teacher & salary. Very helpful!
