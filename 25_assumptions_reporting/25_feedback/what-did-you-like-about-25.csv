I like how we talked about different ways to approach the problem of the data not fitting assumption. this is always one of the most uncertain aspects of analyzing data that comes up.,2020-03-09 15:20:00
"Thank you for teaching this course. I really appreciate the environment you created within the course and within office hours; we felt challenged, but also felt that there was support for us. I also really appreciate the embedded openness and optimism that pervaded the course, as this can be a dry and challenging subject.",2020-03-09 15:10:09
"Thank you for planning this lesson based on what we were interested in and for thinking through the slides in a logical manner. As for the format, Zoom could have been awkward, but I appreciate the thought you put into the process. I can imagine it may have been a little bit less personal for you because you couldn't see all of us whereas we could still see you.",2020-03-09 15:06:22
"Zoom worked well for me. I will say that I would prefer to do a recorded presentation instead of doing it over Zoom. It just seems a little challenging to do it with screen-share, have time for questions, and leave room for some technical issues; especially when individual presenters have only 4 minutes to present. I'm also trying to figure out travel plans to leave campus earlier than expected given the virus, and it would be easier to do the presentation on my own time. Thank you for today's topic, though! I found it really helpful and it also clarified some things that were confusing to me originally.",2020-03-09 15:02:38
"Super helpful to learn more about how to handle violations of model assumptions, particularly as we all head into our own analyses for our final projects (which will likely involve dealing with some similar violations). It did make me wonder if in future years, instead of having HW #7, you gave us all a week to look at the data we're using for our final projects and asked us to test the model assumptions in advance (and then perhaps we could submit questions to Tobi in advance about specific model violations we were experiencing, and how to best handle those). I realize this would (a) require incorporating Bayesian analysis into an earlier HW and (b) prep from the teaching team to respond to specific model violations, but I do think it would be useful...just a thought!",2020-03-09 15:00:44
"Today's class was incredibly helpful and provided a comprehensive overview of everything we covered in the course. Thank you so, so much to the entire teaching team! :)",2020-03-09 14:59:37
This class sped up pretty quickly near the end. Asking questions through Zoom didn't work very well because it took a while for Andrew to notify you that there was a question.,2020-03-09 14:59:33
"Not related to this class in particular, but I would like to mention that, while I feel I understood frequentist statistics quite well, I don't feel the same way with Bayesian statistics. I would have liked to have more practice on Bayesian data analysis.",2020-03-09 14:58:44
"There were some bitrate drops, so the audio got distorted and unintelligible briefly. I think overall, it gets the job done though.",2020-03-09 14:58:40
This was a good class. The details were very well received. Maybe some parts could have gone faster than others.,2020-03-09 14:58:10
"Thank you Tobi! Thanks for your super positive attitude and clear explanations, you helped me really push through this tough course.",2020-03-09 14:57:36
