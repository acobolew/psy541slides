Hello and Happy New Year!

We're excited that you've enrolled in "PSYCH 252: Statistical Methods for Behavioral and Social Sciences". Our class will meet for the first time this Monday (January 7th) from 10:30 - 11:50AM in room 203 in the [History Corner (building 200)](https://campus-map.stanford.edu/?id=200-203).

Here are a few things you can do to get ready for class:

1. Install R and RStudio

A quick tutorial on how to install both is [here](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~gulzar/rstudio/index.html). For RStudio, make sure to download the free "RStudio Desktop Open Source License" version (it's the leftmost one in the table).

2. Sign up for Datacamp and Piazza

We will use Piazza as a discussion board. You can post questions about the materials here, form groups for the final project, and much more. Please sign up [here](https://tinyurl.com/psych252piazza) The access code is: sunnystats
