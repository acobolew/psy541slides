Hi, 

Turns out there are two different ways for downloading folders on Canvas, and only one of the methods downloads the contents in the subfolders as well. 

So make sure to use this method for downloading a folder: 

- Go to Files > slides and then click on the entry 02_visualization1 (don't click on the text)
- Download the folder by clicking on the Download symbol above. 

Don't download the folder by clicking on the three vertical points on the right (this way the contents of subfolders won't be downloaded.)

See you tomorrow, 

Tobi
