What did you like about today's class? What could be improved next time?
Response
I thought the pace was great!
N/a
I liked that the small parts like some conventions and syntax in programming was explained.
"I am hoping that breakout rooms can still be used when the class in hybrid. personally, I am thinking of waiting until 2/1 or so to come in person"
Like the music from the class too!
"I got a little lost in the across() part, since I haven't seen that before. But really appreciated the longer stretch break!"
"wish we had spent more time on the more complex stuff later in class like pivoting, etc. that stuff is generally a lot less intuitive than simple stuff like adding new columns. I mean, hopefully we won't have to waste our time tidying data and we can learn actually statistics in this class so it won't matter... but ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
I finally got the hang of a practice problem and was able to contribute and reproduce the code on my own!! Woohoo!!!!
breakout rooms where we work on code chunks are great!
Really would like another wrangling class just focusing on making data tidy/combining dataframes.
"Most things are improved by chinchillas. If an opportunity arises, they would be much appreciated."
"I'm nervous about how much I actually have learned and worried that I'm in worse shape than I think I am. I understand the material in the class but not sure how well I can replicate the code from scratch, or come up with what I need to do myself."
"Like the functions esp the cross() and .fns& .cols introduced, very helpful"
"Like the breakout rooms; learned %in% better and clarified .names = ""{.cols}_z"" from the discussion, even if we didn't do the practice question"
