I think that the other R stuff that isn't as complex would be learnable through take home kind of coding tutorials that are combined with the homework. This way we can dig deeper into the meat of the class using the first 2 weeks of lecture.,2020-01-15 14:50:37
"I really appreciated learning more about group_by, summarize, and the pivot functions, which appear to be very commonly used. Would like more practice and am looking forward to tomorrow's application section for that. Thanks!",2020-01-15 14:50:01
I found the explanations in the RCode immensely helpful. Thank you for providing clear explanations and breaking down what each chunk of code did piece by piece.,2020-01-15 14:49:50
"For merging data frames, just to be clear, you didn't mention the function ""merge"" because you think it's not a good function (should I learn something else?) or you just didn't have time today?",2020-01-15 14:49:50
Today's material was extremely helpful and enlightening! Overall good pace as well. Where can we find solutions to the in-class practice problems?,2020-01-15 14:49:50
"I appreciate the applied lecture and like all of the practice we had. Although, I would like additional practice in these kinds of lectures because it moved very quickly for me!",2020-01-15 14:49:43
"I liked the very specific parts in the notes where it said ""NOTES_TO:"" does X and ""VALUES_TO"" does Y. This was super super helpful for me in breaking down and knowing what the different parts of the code were doing. I thought it went a little fast for me and I don't totlaly understand why it's necessary to put stuff into ""long"" format.",2020-01-15 14:49:43
I liked the french song from today!,2020-01-15 14:49:42
it's great,2020-01-15 14:49:41
hands-on as well!,2020-01-15 14:49:40
"I liked the practice exercises. I also liked that Tobi explained very clearly the pivot_longer and the pivot_wider functions, by demonstrating at each step what the functions were doing.",2020-01-15 14:49:39
I couldn't follow a great part of it,2020-01-15 14:49:35
I already knew spread and gather decently well. It was useful to learn the new syntax. It was also useful review of other common functions I haven't used in a while.,2020-01-15 14:49:35
More of the separation function stuff might be useful. Definitely want to avoid those gross regex bleh,2020-01-15 14:49:29
I thought the explanation for some of the practice problems was a little too fast. It is working under the assumption that everyone got it correctly and was just checking their answer as opposed to helping those who may still be a little stuck or missed something figure out a correct solution.,2020-01-15 14:49:29
"I like the practice questions, they're really helpful to sort of solidify the information; I think more (even if slightly shorter) would be nice.",2020-01-15 14:49:29
it's great,2020-01-15 14:49:27
"I would have liked to do a few more practice problems on pivot_longer, to make really sure that I got the hang of it.",2020-01-15 14:49:27
"The explanations of the practice examples went WAY too quickly for me (and for many of the people around me). Especially for those of us who are stuck, the explanation went too quickly for me to absorb the mistakes that I made and how to properly correct them.",2020-01-15 14:49:27
Data wrangling tools/ examples were super useful! I will be able to apply some of the things from today's class to a problem that I had in HW #1 :D,2020-01-15 14:49:23
"I really appreciated going over the practice question responses in this class. Compared to the previous sessions, I think this made those questions more meaningful / useful, so I hope this continues (esp. as the courses get more complex!)",2020-01-15 14:49:23
I would like to have some more time to work on the practice problems and discuss them together. Overall I have really enjoyed the data wrangling classes.,2020-01-15 14:49:22
"Helpful explanation of functions, wish it could have gone a bit slower/more explanation of when we would actually use each function. I liked the practice problems throughout.",2020-01-15 14:49:22
"very practical. as i said earlier, more explanations or even illustrations about how each function works",2020-01-15 14:49:21
I found the sessions were too fast. I'd recommend sharing access to datacamp one week before the class starts to have more familiarity with R,2020-01-15 14:49:18
Class was really good. No additional comments.,2020-01-15 14:49:17
I really appreciated the detailed explanations and the animation for joining datasets was a nice touch.,2020-01-15 14:49:17
"I thought these sessions were really helpful- I had taken 251, but these served as a nice reminder of some aspects of what I had learned and an introduction to some details that hadn't been covered before.",2020-01-15 14:49:14
I like how we went through the pivot functions in detail. I have always found those to be the most confusing but powerful features of the dplyr package.,2020-01-15 14:49:12
I really liked the practice problems -- I thought they were appropriately challenging and helpful for solidifying my knowledge of the functions we covered.,2020-01-15 14:49:12
Very helpful & necessary functions - saves life,2020-01-15 14:49:11
I thought the examples were helpful. I had never used the pivot functions so it was good to get acquainted with them. Thanks for staying up to date!,2020-01-15 14:49:10
I found this material extremely useful to my own research.  Dealing with old and messy datasets is a constant issue in my lab.,2020-01-15 14:49:03
I really enjoyed the practice problems. I learn the most with those. Maybe review them just a tad bit slower.,2020-01-15 14:48:59
I think I finally understood the pivot_longer function!! It was utterly mystifying to me the first time I learned it in psych 251. Now it made a lot more sense.,2020-01-15 14:48:58
More time showing the answers for the practice problems before scrolling to the next topic.,2020-01-15 14:48:52
The practice questions were very useful!,2020-01-15 14:48:47
real examples of what I can potentially use later,2020-01-15 14:48:43
more explanations about the specific functions,2020-01-15 14:48:42
