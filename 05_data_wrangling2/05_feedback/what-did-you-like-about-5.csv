"It was very helpful to see the animations of what was happening. I think the class was good, it'll just take time for many of the concepts to soak in and to get familiar with using them. Sometimes the examples seem very simplified versions of the kind of data we will work with (which of course I recognize is also important!), but every now and then it would help to see how you would do this with an actual dataset.",2019-01-16 11:52:40
"Maybe not relevant anymore, but more time for practice problems and less time answering people's specific questions about the workings of particular functions. That seems like something better answered by practice and less by whether or not you happen to know the specific peculiarities of the function. Sorry I contributed to this problem.",2019-01-16 11:52:33
"Thanks for the class. Your rmarkdowns are amazing and I am sure they will serve as good resources even after this class is over. Love the animations, they really help to visualize abstract concepts.",2019-01-16 11:52:29
"a lot of the functions you mentioned today seem really helpful, thanks!",2019-01-16 11:52:26
more time for practice problems. those are the best! Thanks for all the time you put in. you're the best!,2019-01-16 11:52:11
Love that we're starting with practical exercises in R! Excited to learn more stats so that I know how/when to apply these skills. Thanks!,2019-01-16 11:52:09
cannot think of anything now,2019-01-16 11:52:09
"I always had trouble understanding the difference between ""left_join"" and ""right_join,"" so the animations were incredibly helpful. So was your animation about what ""gather"" does!",2019-01-16 11:52:04
I better understand join (which has been confusing me forever)! :),2019-01-16 11:52:03
It's helpful to walk through other students' questions: thank you for addressing them. The list of additional resources will also be essential.,2019-01-16 11:52:01
Good to go through more data wrangling. Nothing really standout good or bad about today.,2019-01-16 11:51:59
"Might be useful to comment in what each function does within the actual code, so that we don't have to keep referring back to the text to see what we have to use/what parameters are necessary",2019-01-16 11:51:57
it was great! looking forward to more conceptual lectures haha,2019-01-16 11:51:57

I loved the animations. They were very informative. I am also very happy that you are going to share the solutions with us. This is going to remove a lot of stress. I can now listen more carefully to the content.,2019-01-16 11:51:48
"I wish we had gotten to the last exercise, but I like that solutions will now be posted on Canvas so we can work on exercises in our own time or if class is moving too quickly.",2019-01-16 11:51:42
"I liked the overview of tidyverse and that you expanded on what was covered in 251. I love the animations too, I often have to try to imagine it and it doesn't work very well, let me tell you!",2019-01-16 11:51:42
It would have been nice to have more time for the practice because they were quite complex.,2019-01-16 11:51:37
I'm really glad that you are now uploading solutions after class! It helps when I go over the course files on my own again.,2019-01-16 11:51:29
Just fantastic. I want to have your babies.,2019-01-16 11:51:28
The pace is just right and I enjoyed the class. I found the reshaping codes very useful! Thanks so much again for the great notes and lecture! :-),2019-01-16 11:51:27
It was difficult to follow today's lecture,2019-01-16 11:51:16
the animated gifs were really helpful!,2019-01-16 11:51:07
