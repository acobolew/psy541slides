"I can see how much you put in the class. I think the class is ambitious to teach students (who don't really have a lot of programming skills) simulations. There are way too much information over there, in addition to the goal of teaching students other important concepts. I completely failed to follow the simulation r code. On the other hand, I also failed to understand other concepts, such as the leave-one-out approach. Perhaps you need to explain much more clearly why this can help to solve the problems of the ""anova()"" in r. I can understand what it is doing but I can't understand why it solves the problems of comparing two models with ""non-overlapped"" predictors.",2019-02-15 11:53:34
I am getting very frustrated with the lady who asks too many questions in the class.  She needs to read the slides ahead of time perhaps. She seems to slow down  the class.,2019-02-15 11:53:10
"The midterm took me 18 hours to finish, but I actually appreciate it! I reviewed and learned so much in the process of finishing the midterm. This is the only midterm that I would save a copy as a reference of R codes for future data analysis.",2019-02-15 11:52:35
"the midterm was really too long. it also felt long for no reason, eg questions tested redundant knowledge (and it felt like the hws in that it was really testing if I could find the relevant R code in the rmd files uploaded with lecture instead of testing more independent problem solving). I hope future students get to take a more concise one.",2019-02-15 11:52:03
"A little too much of reciting code in class today, I think (as opposed to more conceptual content). You lost me a bit. One thing that did come up in the midterm though: why does lm() output a t value and anova output an F value. And what's the difference/relationship between the two.",2019-02-15 11:51:48
This course is awesome! Tobi's doing such a good job of teaching it and getting feedback from students. More technical courses should be like this!,2019-02-15 11:51:39
"I thought the pacing was great! Can you also point us to concise resources that address the underlying math of this stuff? Also, in case it's helpful, I kept track of how much time I spent on the Midterm. 18 hours and 40 minutes.",2019-02-15 11:51:24
Presenting the code can be kind of dense. There is a lot packed into each individual R function. But I appreciate the step by step walk through. I still start to lose it at the end,2019-02-15 11:51:15
I really like today's class. it makes a lot of sense to me,2019-02-15 11:51:04
So satisfying to finally understand LOO!!,2019-02-15 11:50:55
"You need to give us a chance to discuss feedback on the midterm. �Clearly, it was not a 6-hour exam (please report the mean length), and even if it was, you should not have assigned a 6-hour exam to begin with. The purpose of the take-home exam is to offer an exam in a more flexible format. Stanford's exam policy specifies that (final!) exams fit within a 3-hour slot. Unless you have a substantial reason why you cannot evaluate your course material in such a format, you should not use the take-home option as a mechanism to simply assign a longer exam (Stanford even has formal channels for students to bring such practices to the attention of University administrators). Moreover, the exam clearly did not need to be so long, as its length was not due to challenging questions but rather to a great deal of repetitive material. If we can interpret coefficients in a linear regression once, we don't need to do it 3 times more. The classmates with which I spoke shared the sentiment that the midterm was disrespectful of our time (in a fashion similar to that of HW2).",2019-02-15 11:50:52
"Midterm taught me a lot. The hints were super helpful and felt like breadcrumbs that helped point me in the right direction. However, it was too long. 24 questions in 6 hours would mean a question every 15 minutes. Some of the very short ones makes that time feasible, but the multi part questions took me on average an hour or so to complete. Would have been much better if we had a week to complete it.  Also, can we review how to report stats? We talked about it for different examples, but it would be really helpful to review all the different rules for reporting statistics in one thorough session.",2019-02-15 11:50:42
"I think this midterm was a much better way to learn and understand the material than the previous homework. However, it was somewhat repetitive and much too long. 
Additionally, in general it seems more fair to give everyone more time on an exam rather than to given certain students extensions.",2019-02-15 11:50:40
