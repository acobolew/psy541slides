Hi, 

The materials for tomorrow's class are on Canvas now. Please go to Files > slides and then download the folder 03_visualization2. 

It would be great if you could do this today and test whether it works (so that things will run smoothly tomorrow). 

- Download the folder 
- Unzip the file
- Open `03_visualization2.Rproj` with RStudio 
- In RStudio, open the file `visualization2.Rmd`
- Run the code chunk that starts on line 38 to install some packages 
- Now you should be able to run all the code (and knit the file by clicking on the Knit icon above the code editor)

Note that knitting the R Markdown file for the first time will take some time (because of the animation). If you knit it again, it should go much quicker. 

If you experience any problems, then please post these on Piazza so that we can address them before class. 

Thanks!

See you tomorrow, 

Tobi
