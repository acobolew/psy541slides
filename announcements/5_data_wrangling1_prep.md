Hi, 

The materials for Monday's class are on Canvas now. Please go to Files > slides and then download the folder 04_data_wrangling1. 

Again, it would be great if you could test that it works before class, and post any problems you might run into on Piazza. 

Here is the 

- Download the folder 
- Unzip the file
- Open `04_data_wrangling1.Rproj` with RStudio 
- In RStudio, open the file `data_wrangling1.Rmd`
- Run the code chunk that starts on line 33 to install some packages 
- Now you should be able to run all the code (and knit the file by clicking on the Knit icon above the code editor)

Have a nice weekend and see you on Monday! 

Tobi
