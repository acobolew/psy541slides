I really liked the setup of going through the markdown file and doing examples together. It made very easy to jump ahead when we finish early and made it feel like a very efficient use of time,2019-01-09 11:53:08
are students without programming experience able to keep up? I have experience but I felt I had to draw on it a lot in order to complete what was going on,2019-01-09 11:52:51
"The pace is a bit slower, but it is expected for a beginner course. In general, the class is great",2019-01-09 11:52:44
"It was great. I just had to figure out some things when installing packages (my version wouldn't allow me to install without specifying dependencies=TRUE, repos='http://cran.rstudio.com/' so I had to take some time to figure that out but otherwise it was informative! Looking forward to getting more practice with RStudio and ggplot().",2019-01-09 11:52:43
I like that we get hands-on practice in lecture.,2019-01-09 11:52:40
Maybe telling everyone which line we are at now would help. Sometimes I lost track of where we were in the .Rmd file,2019-01-09 11:52:40
"If the goal is to follow along with you, we need slightly more explicit indication of where you are in your code (e.g. line number) and what concept you are demonstrating at that time.",2019-01-09 11:52:34
"The Rmd files for the lecture are great -- really comprehensive and will be helpful resources moving forward. It's tough with technical issues that the TAs need to help students with while we need to move forward as a class. But I think we did a good job of pushing forward and not slowing down too much. I'm interested in learning more about the CI bootstrap function, but I'll review that on my own.",2019-01-09 11:52:31
"The walkthrough of ggplot made things much clearer! I'm hoping to learn how to apply these skills with actual psych data that's a little less straightforward (like how to plot the output of a regression analysis, etc.).",2019-01-09 11:52:28
I like doing in-class exercises but towards the end I was out of sync: was still working on the previous example so I couldn't focus on your introduction of the new topic.,2019-01-09 11:52:26
Going through the script with us was effective (much better than just instructions on slides),2019-01-09 11:52:24
Good class! Stress testing the tech related stuff would be helpful (i.e. make sure figures are available for students). But I'm sure you were thinking that over,2019-01-09 11:52:23
Wasn't too sure why we used certain things such as mean_cl_boot,2019-01-09 11:52:22
I like how detailed you went to go through what each line of code means. It is very helpful for those who do not have much experience in R. That's all :D,2019-01-09 11:52:22
i wish we had a bit more time to go over the extra tools (like tinytex and such) since i think those are super slick and will take a little time to pick up/make sure everyone's stuff is running,2019-01-09 11:52:20
"I loved the r markdown file profiling all of the code. so intuitive. you also did an incredible job of explaining how to use ggplot. I think when technical glitches come up in the future, e.g. with the files, feel free to not to wait as long especially if having the content is not totally necessary to follow along ...",2019-01-09 11:52:20
"Writing all the packages we need to install in the Rmd file somewhere so we can just copy and paste into console, instead of installing along the way. I did appreciate it being in the email, but it's easier to have it in Rmd so that I don't have to have another window open",2019-01-09 11:52:16
"I liked going step by step and being able to ask questions. The Wi-fi was super slow when downloading the images though, so maybe next time we could try to minimize any internet-requiring activities.",2019-01-09 11:52:15
"I liked how you provided all lecture notes (and the R Markdown file) so that I can go home and keep practicing. However, I thought the pace of the class was a little too fast, and I would like more frequent check-ins to make sure that everyone's code is working. I like the sticky note system!",2019-01-09 11:52:12
Pace was good. For those of us with experience with ggplot it may be a good idea to give us more challenging tasks.,2019-01-09 11:52:12
I think it may be more useful to have us to the practice exercises at home/outside of class and use class time to go over ideas/concepts etc...,2019-01-09 11:52:07
It would be great if you could talk about each elements of of the function a little more in depth and do the examples on your computer as we watch.,2019-01-09 11:52:07
I enjoyed the bad plot bashing! No complaints about this class today,2019-01-09 11:52:06
Sometimes I was confused about where you were in the R script but you started calling out the line numbers towards the end which was really helpful!,2019-01-09 11:52:02
"You explain things very well, building on knowledge step by step. Very impressed, since this is difficult for many teachers of technical subjects. Great job!",2019-01-09 11:52:00
"I liked looking at an RMarkdown file together. The difficulties with getting the right files was annoying, but I'm sure just a one-time event.",2019-01-09 11:51:58
I liked that the TAs were available to help.,2019-01-09 11:51:51
maybe it could be more fun to do more challenging graphs.,2019-01-09 11:51:50
"I liked being able to work through the exercises. I wished we had more clear ""learning goals"" laid out at the start of the class.",2019-01-09 11:51:49
The materials are very informative.,2019-01-09 11:51:48
"I liked how you justified the importance of visualization. We're always told to do so but it's great to have helpful examples. I think it was a great class, thank you :)!",2019-01-09 11:51:46
It was great to learn how to integrate stat_summary into plots. Especially for the error bars. I also liked the motivation for plotting in general.,2019-01-09 11:51:44
"i wish i had read through the rmd file before hand - i think it would help orient me, because you have lots of helpful comments in there. i will be doing this in the future :)",2019-01-09 11:51:42
the group walk-through of code and independent examples is super helpful! i love that.,2019-01-09 11:51:39
I liked the use of the sticky notes to indicate if we were done or needed help.,2019-01-09 11:51:34
it was really good but also your lecture notes are so good i'm tempted to not go to class anymore since i know i will be able to learn from them >__>,2019-01-09 11:51:32
It was very easy to follow along with you in R.,2019-01-09 11:51:31
I liked having the interactive coding and being able to work with the people around us.,2019-01-09 11:51:29
"a bit slow, but because of the technical difficulties encountered in starting a new class",2019-01-09 11:51:27
Easy to follow along,2019-01-09 11:51:18
