"I liked the very clear RMarkdown file, it helped in following along. That being said, it may have been more effective, if not chaotic for you to let us work through the document in smaller groups, then ask questions of you and the TAs as we go along.",2020-01-08 15:20:16
can you give us the playlist,2020-01-08 15:09:10
Update: I really am happy to speed thru R basics bc I know them. I will want to move a little slower probably once we get to the stats.,2020-01-08 15:01:34
"I'm a little lost, but I have zero experience with R, and I appreciate the help from TA etc.",2020-01-08 14:50:31
Just more time andante clarify when we are supposed to use our cards. Is it just for the 5 min periods when we work on our own or for the entire class?,2020-01-08 14:50:27
I enjoyed the detailed explanations for the reasons for errors in R. I also thought the practice sets were a good way to consolidate the newly learned concepts. Please I would like the notes to always be available a day before the class.,2020-01-08 14:50:11
"I appreciated starting with the basics and not assuming prior knowledge. I'd like to know more about stat_summary (and specifically, if we do actually want to calculate the means, SDs, etc. as separate columns in our data frame, what are the functions that will allow us to do that?) Thanks!",2020-01-08 14:50:10
"I really appreciated the notes included in the RMarkdown document we used today in class. It will be so helpful to refer back to moving forward. Also, the pace of the class was great. Time went by quickly but I could still grasp the material.",2020-01-08 14:50:09
"The class was way too fast for me as I don't know much about R. However, the instructor was clear. I just have to catch up to speed. Now I know that it is fast-paced, so I'll be better prepared for future classes.",2020-01-08 14:50:08
I appreciated the way that class was structured when it came to going over examples and then having us use the examples to complete our own plots. Reminded me a lot of how datacamp is structured.,2020-01-08 14:50:08
"it was really helpful to have the whole RMarkdown file to follow along,",2020-01-08 14:50:06
I didn't know about summary_stat or grouping within ggplot before and found it to be a useful alternative to pre-processing data. Breaking each function or element down a little more could be useful in the future.,2020-01-08 14:49:58
I enjoyed the hands-on style of the class. The r markdowns are very thorough.,2020-01-08 14:49:55
I thought that doing the coding where we could copy/paste/tweak was very helpful.,2020-01-08 14:49:52
"I really liked the extensive examples given. I'm very familiar with ggplot but I learned some things today (e.g., stat _summary! I'd been the unfortunate person creating means and calculating error bars as separate variables and then plotting them). Maybe next year there could be a ""challenge"" section for people who are already familiar with R/ggplot?",2020-01-08 14:49:51
"I was surprised by how much overlap there was between the course material and the course readings posted on the website (i.e. word-for-word). Should I assume moving forward that we don't need to complete the readings *before* class, but rather that they are most helpful for reviewing anything we missed / need clarity on after a class?",2020-01-08 14:49:45
I liked learning about stat_summary. Send very useful.,2020-01-08 14:49:45
"I liked the parts where we had time to work on our own. But the start was too fast and I got behind by quite a bit when r ran into a problem opening ggplot. So overall it was a fine pace, but a little tricky at some points getting started.",2020-01-08 14:49:40
I like the hands on examples -very helpful for learning!,2020-01-08 14:49:39
Pace is good. Perhaps  more time for practice.,2020-01-08 14:49:36
"(And I ALWAYS ran into errors with the ""set working directory,"" so I think R Projects will be very helpful in fixing that and I would like to learn how!)",2020-01-08 14:49:36
The detailed notes alongside the code examples was great. Could have used some more insight into the logic behind specific functions (like the global vs. localized specifications; that was helpful).,2020-01-08 14:49:28
"I liked that walked through things in what felt like a logical progression, and that the practice exercises were feasible for my level of skill. I like that Tobi took time to answer the questions that were brought up thoughtfully and thoroughly. Having the Rmd file available for download made following along easy.",2020-01-08 14:49:25
I liked having opportunities to practice the skills we've learned during class. I also really appreciate the extensive list of resources provided -- I imagine this will be incredibly useful throughout the course!,2020-01-08 14:49:21
Overall this was great! :) Thanks for all the resources + super clear organization,2020-01-08 14:49:21
It may be nice to actually have more individual/group exercises. I usually find that this kind of material is hard to learn until I have the opportunity to apply it.,2020-01-08 14:49:17
"I like the great coding explanation - that we can keep for later and consult. Given I have little experience with R, it was a bit fast to me.",2020-01-08 14:49:13
"Just a heads up that I noticed today before class, two of the data camp courses listed on the course website under the first day (RStudio IDE 1, RStudio IDE 2) are archived on data camp and are no longer available.",2020-01-08 14:49:12
"I know most of this stuff, so I'm happy we breezed through it. In general, though, it was pretty fast and I'm not sure how much syntax I internalized.",2020-01-08 14:49:11
"I really liked the parts where we did ""hands-on"" exercises and wrote code ourselves. I wish we could have spent a little more time (as a group) going over the ""correct"" code, because I felt that the answer part went a little too quickly for those of us who made mistakes.",2020-01-08 14:49:07
I appreciated that you went through each chunk in R and also gave us a chance to try on our own. I would say we should have more examples that we go through together and try on our own,2020-01-08 14:49:05
"Good overview of ggplot, would like more explanation of stat_summary (would be helpful to go over what common stats you can use it for and what their arguments are)",2020-01-08 14:49:02
"The practice plots were super helpful, TAs were really helpful! I thought the explanations of functions in the sheet were great, but it would be awesome if they could be released 1-2 days before class. I think I would be much better prepared if I could read through all of it before coming to class.",2020-01-08 14:49:01
"It was good for people (like me) who already know ggplot, as a refresher - I worry that people who didn't know it yet might have been a bit overwhelmed.",2020-01-08 14:48:59
Very clear explanations. I liked that we had practice exercises.,2020-01-08 14:48:59
It's very useful to have access to all these types of graphs. I'm looking forward to reflecting on the code and referencing it when I'm creating plots in the future.,2020-01-08 14:48:57
I like the small examples to practice that reinforced the concepts you talked about in class.,2020-01-08 14:48:55
I still didn't figure out how to do an R Project properly. Am I supposed to save the file from Canvas into the R project I created? What if I create a new file? Still not quite sure how to use R Project properly.,2020-01-08 14:48:55
"It was really cool to just see the different types of graphs and plots and which are more effective for what sorts of data, why, and how. I think the resources provided at the end were very useful as well. The mini-practice questions was also good.",2020-01-08 14:48:52
"Having taken 251, it was pretty repetitive at times, but it felt like it was pretty understandable for people with a wide variety of prior experience.",2020-01-08 14:48:52
very practical and hands-on. Can zoom-in the screen a little bit next time,2020-01-08 14:48:51
I liked that I could see how to plot nice graphs but the pace was a little fast,2020-01-08 14:48:45
"Lots of support from TAs and Prof, nice ambience/atmosphere created by Prof (love the music)",2020-01-08 14:48:44
Hands-on coding experience to a new R learner,2020-01-08 14:48:37
it is hard to follow for beginners. Not enough time to make sense of what is going on.,2020-01-08 14:48:29
