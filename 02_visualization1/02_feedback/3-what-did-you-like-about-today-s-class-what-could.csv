Love starting class with new music. Great intro to class lecture didn't feel like I'm missing any info and I know class expectations. No improvements necessary
Good
"maybe consistent/same breakout room groups? to form community, rather than seeing new faces all the time"
"Love the transparency about anonymous feedback collection, the one minute stretch, and the acknowledge on Data camp."
"music, break , flow of class"
I liked the breakout groups but am a little worried about the projects since I want to do something new but don't know where to start
the introduction to the importance of R is really clear!
Pretty much the same info we got in 251 but it's a nice refresher for those of us who haven't touched R since finishing the 251 final project
I liked the level of detail that you went into when explaining things! The class seems very friendly and definitely not as intimidating as I thought it would be
"stretch break, thanks"
Appreciated that the TAs popped in our breakout room and checked if we needed help.
"I liked the culture setting slide and wished it was introduced earlier, at the beginning of the class. It also helps to start each class with a culture setting slide (e.g., on collaborative learning and growth, emphasizing progress over ""perfect"" codes)."
Some interface things with R Studio could be explained better.
"i liked the breakout groups and getting to talk to new people, as well as hearing more about the teaching team."
The stretch break :)
"Can you go over the clicking procedures twice? Once slowly and a second time to quickly summarize. I live in Rains and the WiFi SUCKS on Stanford campus. The repetition may help, but I also don't want this practice to bog down covering all of the class objectives."
I really enjoyed today's class. It put to ease some of my nerves around taking stats :)
Tobi is nice! I like how he talks
Very friendly and inviting to a new class at the start of a new quarter that's all online -.-
Liked having a defined break! Hope that continues :)
Really liked working through the problem in the breakout group!
"Really impressed with the slides! The stretch break was great and I appreciate the music to set the vibes in the class. Although it was fine since I didn't need (I think) to take notes this time, the pace felt a little fast for if we were reviewing concepts."
