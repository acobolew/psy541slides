What did you like about today's class? What could be improved next time?
Response
"apparently i had some package error so i was not able to participate. I thought i had downloaded everything prior to and even attended section, so i don't know if there was more I could have done to prepare, I didn't know there was an error"
The first part of class was covered in our section yesterday. Still great to double down on these concepts.
Having two monitors helped a lot. I appreciated learning the keyboard shortcuts.
"i liked the ""see one, do one"" recreation exercise."
"I liked going through the markdown page together, it was very helpful to learn about the keyboard shortcuts!"
I liked having a clear goal of making our plot look like the practice plot so that we had more direction
"I think it would be more convenient if we can download class materials using Github fetch, which will keep our local class folder more organized. Thanks!"
NA
"It's a bit tricky to juggle Zoom and R Studio windows all at once. I think I'll get better with some practice, though."
I really liked the interactiveness from the breakout rooms working on a task together
stay on the new code longer before scrolling for those who might be typing out instead of pasting
It was helpful to go over what all the components of ggplot mean (e.g. aes() ). Hope we continue doing that. Also enjoyed teh group work and getting to try it outâ€”would be helpful to share the answer after the groupwork in case we don't get it in the alloted time
I thought the pace was nice
"I already feel lost. In the time it took me to find the menus, I fell behind and didn't catch up for the rest of the class."
"I wish the class was a bit longer so that more things can be explained in detail, especially the practice session at the end of the class. We didn't get to finish making the plot"
Would want more practice time: self or with the group
I thought there was a good pace.
"visualization stuff was useful; the first ~hour or so was not. think it's a waste of time to go over ""good graphing practices"" and such in a stanford graduate school course"
Group work in break out rooms;
"The pace was great, as well as how annotated the rmd file was. Also, the keyboard shortcuts are really helpful!"
"I think it's hard to follow along doing it as you are doing it, so I'll definitely be using the recording to go back through everything. Once the first 2 weeks of the quarter are passed and we're (hopefully) back in person, will lectures still be recorded so we can go through? I am a bit worried about that."
optional breakout room options based on skill level
The practice problems were really helpful! And the stretch break + additional resources
"being able to play around with the plots on our own was very useful. when demonstrating and elaborating on screen, please don't scroll just allow us to observe it's a bit distracting if the screen is moving while trying to listen/read captions."
"I liked diving in! Maybe slowing down a bit would be helpful for me, but I think that might be the case because I don't have a lot of R experience"
