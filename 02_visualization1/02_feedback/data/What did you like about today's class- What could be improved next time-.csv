What did you like about today's class? What could be improved next time?
Response
"I liked the explanation on editing options like softwrap, keyboard shortcuts and {r eval} which I did not know about before. Maybe TAs could walk around and help out whenever a student is facing issues. These could be package download issues or other issues so that all students are on the same page while following the tutorial"
I enjoyed the interactive walkthrough. Just wish there was a little more time to follow along and formulate questions.
"When showing us tips and tricks at the beginning, it would have helped me if you paused to make sure we all got it. There were a couple times when I looked down at my screen for a couple seconds and then never got to see where you clicked to do something. The rest of the class was great!"
"It was good! I think it might have been fun to get slightly trickier ""advanced"" plotting exercises :)"
Loved the example dataset and the figures we got to make!
Good content and really helpful reference material
