# Visualization 1: Exercise solutions 

## Load packages and set theme 

Let's first load the packages that we need for this chapter. 

```{r load_packages, message=FALSE}
library("knitr") # for rendering the RMarkdown file
library("tidyverse") # for data wrangling 
```

Let's set the plotting theme. 

```{r plotting_theme}
theme_set(
  theme_classic()+ #set the theme 
    theme(text = element_text(size = 20)) #set the default text size
)
```

## Practice plot 1

Make a scatter plot that shows the relationship between the variables `depth` (on the x-axis), and `table` (on the y-axis). Take a look at the description for the `diamonds` dataset so you know what these different variables mean. Your plot should look like the one shown in Figure \@ref(fig:practice-plot1).

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = depth, y = table)) +
  geom_point()
```

```{r practice-plot1, out.width="90%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Practice plot 1."}
include_graphics("figures/practice_plot1.png")
```

## Practice plot 2

Make a bar plot that shows the average `price` of diamonds (on the y-axis) as a function of their `clarity` (on the x-axis). Also add error bars. Your plot should look like the one shown in Figure \@ref(fig:practice-plot2).

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = clarity, y = price)) +
  stat_summary(fun.y = "mean", geom = "bar") +
  stat_summary(fun.data = "mean_cl_boot", geom = "linerange")
```

```{r practice-plot2, out.width="90%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Practice plot 2."}
include_graphics("figures/practice_plot2.png")
```

## Practice plot 3

Recreate the plot shown in Figure \@ref(fig:practice-plot3).

```{r}
# make practice plot 3 here
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = color, y = price, group = clarity, color = clarity)) +
  stat_summary(fun.data = "mean_cl_boot", geom = "linerange", size = 1) +
  stat_summary(fun.y = "mean", geom = "line", size = 2)
```


```{r practice-plot3, out.width="90%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Practice plot 3."}
include_graphics("figures/practice_plot3.png")
```

#### Practice plot 4

Recreate the plot shown in Figure \@ref(fig:practice-plot4).

```{r}
# make practice plot 4 here
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = color, y = price, fill = cut)) +
  stat_summary(fun.y = "mean",
               geom = "bar",
               position = position_dodge(width = 0.9),
               color = "black") +
  stat_summary(fun.data = "mean_cl_boot",
               geom = "linerange",
               position = position_dodge(width = 0.9),
               color = "black") +
  facet_grid(rows = vars(clarity)) +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10))
```

```{r practice-plot4, out.width="90%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Practice plot 4."}
include_graphics("figures/practice_plot4.png")
```
