"The lecture is pretty clear in illustrating the concepts of lmer models. But I think, in the future, you may want to make use of some mathematical equations to clearly illustrate how the model can remove ""random intercept"", ""correlations between random effects"" and etc. This is because I still find it difficult to wrap my head around for all these concepts by simply looking at the lmer model syntax, instead of the read equations. Thanks!",2019-03-01 11:51:23
GLM seems GREAT. Really excited about this. Titanic examples were perfect. Great class.,2019-03-01 11:50:50
"Just a quick thank you for investing so much time into the class slides, R scripts, and resources. I know this doesn't really get rewarded career-wise here but I've had a number of conversations with colleagues about how much your work is appreciated.",2019-03-01 11:50:47
Really liked the class. I thought the visualizations of the tumor data were super helpful.,2019-03-01 11:50:18
"Might have been helpful to  explain what ""converging"" meant before explaining what to do about it. Otherwise, this was great!",2019-03-01 11:50:11
