"I finally understand all the stats I've been doing!! Well, most of it. What exactly does an ANOVA do?",2019-01-30 11:50:10
"I understand how to run regressions in r but the procedures slide is still a little confusing to me, even though I think I understand the intuition",2019-01-30 11:50:06
"Great explanation of regression. In general, I really appreciate the time you take in making the Rmd files and the slides. They are so organized and clear - plus beautiful! And have a great personality too...",2019-01-30 11:49:58
Thanks for the lecture. I thought it was very useful in understanding linear regression and how to interpret the parameters,2019-01-30 11:49:51
I thought the conceptual overviews of correlation and regression were good. These models definitely seem simpler than some of the studies we will run and data we will be analyzing (2x2 etc) so I hope we will learn the skills to do those as well! This was helpful though. The game was cool :D,2019-01-30 11:49:49
"Enjoyed the ""competition."" Could have done a few more throughout with related issues, maybe even track scores for the duration of the class.",2019-01-30 11:49:28
thanks for clearing up our confusion about f stats. application of linear regression went by rather quickly. would love to see clearly when we can use what tools,2019-01-30 11:49:27
"Does OLS stand for ""Ordinary"" Least Square instead?",2019-01-30 11:49:27
So if error isn't normally distributed what statistic do you use? Can you check what distribution the error is from?,2019-01-30 11:49:22
I liked the correlation game :) also appreciated the further explanation of the relationship between the F statistic and the sampling distribution of PRE,2019-01-30 11:49:21
Regression is a topic that may have been covered by some students before. It may have been helpful to allow us to practice running regressions on R similar to some of the visualization exercises.,2019-01-30 11:49:19
I would have liked some more clarity on when to use a Spearman's correlation.,2019-01-30 11:49:14
The pace was perfect today. Thank you,2019-01-30 11:49:10
It was a nice introduction to both topics.,2019-01-30 11:49:07
I liked how we slowly worked through all the different parts that build up to what an lm and anova are doing under the hood.,2019-01-30 11:49:06
Think going through these concrete examples today really helped with understanding what you went through on Monday,2019-01-30 11:49:05
Thanks for re-explaining F Statistic! It makes much more sense to me now.,2019-01-30 11:49:00
The competition was engaging and lighthearted,2019-01-30 11:48:59
Tobi did an excellent job of everything. This class is great! Keep it up!,2019-01-30 11:48:58
The correlation game was super fun and creative - thanks Toby!,2019-01-30 11:48:49
