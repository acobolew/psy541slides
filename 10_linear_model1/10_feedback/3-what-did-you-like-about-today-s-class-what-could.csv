Tobi's explanation of how to interpret results from r was really clear to me. I appreciate it very much!
"I found the breakout room exercise example that included suicide to be quite triggering, particularly given the ""light-hearted"" nature of the exercise and thus framing mental health as something that is not serious or something to ""joke"" about. Particularly given the tight coupling of students who struggle with mental health in university settings, I would recommend removing that example in future iterations of the class/exercise."
The correlation vs. causation activity was hilarious.
