What did you like about today's class? What could be improved next time?
Response
"The little chocolate competition was really fun! Even if there are no prizes, I am always excited about getting to go over examples independently in class and go over them. I learn best that way."
Let us try/ see the process of how things are derived
Thought the pace was perfect
"The pace of the last 3-4 classes has been great, and the slides help to explain the statistics. However, a huge challenge is how this translates to the code used in R. When I am reviewing the rmd files it has been difficult for me to know what each of the commands and arguments are doing, and how they are linked to the statistics taught in the class. To help with this, could you please provide more notes in the rmd files that explains what the commands and arguments are doing. In my case, I perhaps need more ""elementary"
General question: can we have assignment due on Friday evening: Thursday midnight?
is there space to use our own data set for assignments
"Class today cleared up so many questions I had about pearson vs. spearman, what goes on under the hood of a t-test in R, etc. Plus the game was fun! And I liked the bear eating chocolate on one of your slides -- really thankful this course makes learning stats/R feel accessible and fun."
