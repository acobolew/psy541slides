What did you like about today's class? What could be improved next time?
Response
very good class today- super informative!
Just want to voice support for the recap at the beginning of class â€” please don't shorten it!
These concepts are just hard I'll have to self study
"if possible, it would be helpful to go through the equations again and take time to explain each of the arguments mean conceptually. thank you!"
I liked the example data sets used for clarification!
I would like to defend long recaps! Esp as we move into regressions!!!
Thanks!!
