# Visualization 2: Exercise solutions 

## Load packages and set plotting theme

Let's first load the packages that we need for this chapter. 

```{r load_packages, message=FALSE}
library("knitr") # for rendering the RMarkdown file
library("tidyverse") # for data wrangling 
```

Let's set the plotting theme. 

```{r plotting_theme}
theme_set(
  theme_classic()+ #set the theme 
    theme(text = element_text(size = 20)) #set the default text size
)
```

## Practice plot 1 

Try to make the plot shown in Figure \@ref(fig:practice-plot1). Here are some tips: 

- For the data argument in `ggplot()` use: `df.diamonds[1:1000, ]` (this selects the first 1000 rows).
- Note that the violin plots have different areas that reflect the number of observations. Take a look at `geom_violin()`'s help file to figure out how to set this. 

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds[1:10000, ], 
       mapping = aes(x = cut, y = price)) +
  geom_violin(scale = "count") +
  geom_point(
    alpha = 0.1,
    position = position_jitter(width = 0.1)
  ) +
  stat_summary(
    fun.y = "mean",
    shape = 21,
    geom = "point",
    fill = "blue",
    size = 5
  )
```

```{r practice-plot1, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Practice plot 1.'}
include_graphics("figures/practice_plot1.png")
```
