"A little fast and unsure if this is normal for the class. If we are finding the pace fast, is it useful to look over the Rmd notes and try the practice problems ahead of time? Or will we then be too ahead of class?"
I think that the breakout groups are effective and helpful as long as someone knows what they're doing. I think the pacing/class time doesn't match the content in the class Rmds though
the charts were awesome. breakout rooms were fun too. thanks Tobi :)
"Everything was explained perfectly clearly, and I liked that the practice plots were similar to the examples Tobi walked through."
I loved my breakout group and also appreciated the depth of explanation when going over the different ways to visualize data. It felt a little rushed towards the end tho
the charts!
"I think there was too much time spent on Visualization 1 (which was a bit too slow) but then Visualization 2 went by way too quickly, and we didn't even reach the end---or, at least, I didn't quite have time to process everything in Viz 2. So I think it wasn't really a question of pacing, but rather the allocation of time, that could be improved. Perhaps we could have nixed one of the two breakout sessions for Viz 1 and spent that doing one of the practice plots for Viz 2 instead? Overall, though, I gave a green smiley face because I think this was a helpful class and I learned a lot about R that I didn't know before!"
"After scrolling to a line of code, give us 7 seconds to catch up to the same line of code."
Can you put the code solutions in the chat after going over the problem? So it is up on the screen longer and I can fix my errors
Like the breakout room working together time !
