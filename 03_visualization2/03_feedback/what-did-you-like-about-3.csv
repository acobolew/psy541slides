The lecture code and PDFs seem like they'll be valuable resources. Thanks for sharing them!,2020-01-10 14:52:13
"Like I said last week, I know this R stuff so I don't mind the speed. I'm hoping we'll move slower on the stats and go in depth on the modeling.",2020-01-10 14:51:30
"I wish we could spend a little more time on the content and less time on reviewing feedback. I think it's *great* that you are so interested in soliciting our feedback, but I also want to be sure we can cover the most complicated material in class. Maybe a digest email at the end of the week? Or allow people with specific questions to include their name so they can be contacted directly?",2020-01-10 14:50:59
I thought the class followed a clear path and the goal was obvious. I also appreciated seeing the combined plots. It's good to know what is possible!,2020-01-10 14:50:50
"This class was a bit faster than last time, but still manageable. I would appreciate decomposing the code a bit in class and thinking about how to debug this way to really understand what the code is doing. But that's sort of built into the existing file now, so it's manageable for us to go through it ourselves.",2020-01-10 14:50:46
"Not sure how much to be following along on the board vs. on laptop. I guess it's personal preference, but today's class was mostly lecture minus one hands-on example and I think that laptops might be distracting in this case...",2020-01-10 14:50:44
"The pace of this class was better. This was due to a better understanding of how the project files were organized, which allowed us to better see what was going on.  It may be best to remind us about this organization especially in the first few classes.",2020-01-10 14:50:41
I'd love to revisit / go into greater depth on stat_summary – I don't have a great sense of the range of ways it can be used. I also would have enjoyed one more practice plot in class!,2020-01-10 14:50:35
LITTLE BE FAST. SHOULD BE LITTLE BIT SLOW,2020-01-10 14:50:29
"The directions for each step were very clear. Maybe more independent work would be nice, but overall I enjoyed today's class.",2020-01-10 14:50:28
Visualizations are fun. Would love more practice (as a group) thinking through a set of data and designing the best ways to visualize it.,2020-01-10 14:50:27
I enjoyed seeing many examples of different ways we can visualize data!,2020-01-10 14:50:23
Really like all of the ggplot examples and the gganimate example at the end. Would have been interested to see more of a full introduction to shiny.,2020-01-10 14:50:19
"The pace was really good, I really liked the example code (like the skeleton code) because I felt like I could easily use it in the future! :)",2020-01-10 14:50:19
"I like hearing Tobi's tips, tricks, and shortcuts. Those seem really useful.",2020-01-10 14:50:14
"I liked that we were exposed to a lot of different types of graphs and other useful things (such as the keyboard shortcuts). I would have liked more time to practice those things together. However, I think we'll get a change to do that in our homeworks and in sections.",2020-01-10 14:50:11
"I learned a ton of useful skills in today's class! No specific suggestions for improvement -- the pace, class material, etc., was all great!",2020-01-10 14:50:09
"I loved how we got to see the breadth of plots that are possible (bar charts, pie charts, scatterplots, violin plots, etc.). It was just a lot to process, especially for those of us that haven't done stats in a while. If possible, I would have loved to discuss the pros and cons of each type of visualization in a little more detail.",2020-01-10 14:50:09
I liked the pace of class today. No suggestions.,2020-01-10 14:50:02
👍,2020-01-10 14:50:01
A lot of useful practical ways to modify details of the graphs for making them very customizable and ready for publications. Thanks!,2020-01-10 14:50:00
I liked the hands-on visualization practice. I think there can be more practice problems and a little less lecture.,2020-01-10 14:49:58
More practice examples would have been nice.,2020-01-10 14:49:50
"great class! super cool to see the animated visuals, especially the bar plot illustration -- that was very helpful!",2020-01-10 14:49:47
Liked seeing different plots and uses for them; would have liked more in-class practice plots,2020-01-10 14:49:46
"Less fast than less time, I was better able to follow through, apart from the last 5minutes (but those seems advanced extras anyway?).",2020-01-10 14:49:45
It was nice! No specific suggestions.,2020-01-10 14:49:39
I liked the several examples and great code.,2020-01-10 14:49:36
"I liked that you went over the practice problems in class this time, that helped to make sure we were all on the same page.",2020-01-10 14:49:27
"I liked the scaffolding of information, the level of thinking, and the practicality.",2020-01-10 14:49:25
the pace at the very end was a bit fast,2020-01-10 14:49:16
