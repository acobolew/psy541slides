"I like the music. And the hammer. I felt we went too quickly over the last bit of the visualization 2 file, which is probably the content that is most unfamiliar to most people. For example, I'm still not sure what snippets are.",2019-01-11 11:51:59
"It would be helpful if you could pause at your code a little more once we have made our practice plots (for future lectures). Also we covered a lot of types of plots which was good, but it would've helped to focus on the most commonly used ones and ways to edit and customize that - we can explore the other types at home. Thank you!",2019-01-11 11:51:52
"I think the lecture about class 3 is way too fast for beginners to follow. I really appreciate the lecture notes that you have prepared and it is very informative. However, if we can save time at the beginning of the lecture (not to talk about the poll results , and you can simply email us the results), then perhaps we will have much more time to talk about the lecture. Another thing that I will appreciate is that if you can talk about more how to interpret a violin/joy plots, this will be awesome, as traditional stats class did not talk about these!",2019-01-11 11:51:52
"Good to push my knowledge of R - a ""reproduce this plot"" works well to make me think deeper about plots - instead of changing what I want to visualize because of my knowledge I expand my knowledge to make what I want to plot.",2019-01-11 11:51:47
"Great overall. Possibly too much material planned for 1 class. The exercises are super helpful. Note that our lines in the code don't match yours once we fill in an exercise, so direct references to lines as poiters to where we are don't always work.",2019-01-11 11:51:30
The music.,2019-01-11 11:51:23
"Pace was a tiny bit fast, but I guess that's fine since we can always go back to the RMarkdown files and go through the exercises on our own at home. I love how much attention you give to the feedback and very impressed by how flexible you are.",2019-01-11 11:51:22
"Great class! Maybe a note to the lines in the R Markdown files: When exercises are included or you show other things in between, the lines get messed up which is why I often need longer time to actually find where we are. This is just something you might want to keep in mind.",2019-01-11 11:51:22
Explained earlier,2019-01-11 11:51:17
"Learned a lot of new tricks about ggplot, which is helpful. This class (so far) is perfect after Mike's 251, and I'm glad we're not going any slower. For section, maybe we could do some more of the hands on things. I like seeing it on the screen and agree that we don't have time to do too many practice plots. But I want to make sure it's reinforced, so I'm hoping section could solve that problem.",2019-01-11 11:51:16
Like the diversity of graphs we generated,2019-01-11 11:51:15
I am really enjoying the class so far! I love the music and I thought the animations showing how some way of graphing data can actually be misleading (e.g. boxplots) was very useful. I didn't think I was going to like a stats class this much :),2019-01-11 11:51:13
The music is great!,2019-01-11 11:51:08
Lovedddd today class. Very clear and good pace. I loved that you were walking us through each line of code. I think it would be great to set a timer for the in class practices so we don't run out of time.,2019-01-11 11:51:07
"I thought it was a good class! I think mastering ggplot takes a lot of time and it's kind of endless skillset, so it just takes a ton of practice and iteration",2019-01-11 11:51:06
Thank you for another great lecture! I think it would be useful if we incorporated data from psychological experiments in our practice problems in class. Love the music!,2019-01-11 11:51:03
"After an in-class exercise, the line # in my code are no longer exactly the same with the instructor's copy, that led to some confusion for me during class.",2019-01-11 11:51:02
"I like the contents today, and hopefully in homework/next classes, we could make some cool things with shiny apps",2019-01-11 11:51:00
"As we fill out our practice exercises in the RMD file, our line numbers begin to differ from yours. Can you refer to them by tag, or find some consistent way of pointing out how to follow along with you?",2019-01-11 11:50:58
It's nice to have the in-class Rmd files as far in advance as possible. I like to work through them before class so I can keep up.,2019-01-11 11:50:58
I liked how detailed and comprehensive your ggplot examples are. I just wish we had more time to digest and practice. Will do so at home.,2019-01-11 11:50:48
Today's class was super useful! The markdown files provided will be an excellent resource moving forward. I appreciate that you're teaching us skills without expecting us to memorize everything because there's a lot of content. Thanks!,2019-01-11 11:50:48
I liked the RMarkdown format where we can go at our own pace. I think having a multitude of graphs as reference for ourselves later when we need to make graphs on our own will be extremely useful.,2019-01-11 11:50:44
The explanation for note choice was heartwarming - thank you,2019-01-11 11:50:39
"i liked that we finished up yesterday's lecture instead of just moving on. Today's pace was okay, but would have liked 1 more practice problem from today's material to really solidify it. Thanks!",2019-01-11 11:50:39
I liked that you broke down the different elements of a graph and introduced them slowly so that we know what each line or segment of code does,2019-01-11 11:50:34
"This class was far too fast for me. As someone with no programming experience, I plan to use the Datacamp sources, and I hope it'll get better in the future. Thank you for the helpful R Markdown files!",2019-01-11 11:50:32
keep doing what youre doing : ),2019-01-11 11:50:32
No major thoughts.,2019-01-11 11:50:29
"The R markdowns are great, and I also liked the exercises.",2019-01-11 11:50:24
good speed covering good content!,2019-01-11 11:50:20
many examples,2019-01-11 11:50:20
A pulse check about whether everyone is following you would be great.,2019-01-11 11:50:11
Nice job!,2019-01-11 11:50:06
you should play joy division during the breaks as a callback to the joy plots,2019-01-11 11:50:06
