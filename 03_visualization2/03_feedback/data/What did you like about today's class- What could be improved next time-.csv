What did you like about today's class? What could be improved next time?
Response
I like how you explain things.
Really like the breakout discussion & practice. Learned good stuffs.
"Pace today was great, and I appreciated all the explanations as you went along, even just explaining what a certain button does."
"I liked some of the break down and walk through, it was really fun getting to work through the examples and then seeing the answer if we were hitting a wall."
"liked that we dived into actual material, thought it was well-paced. if you could post the rmds with solutions after class (which I think you said you would) that would be super helpful to go back to when we forget something"
maybe having a few more questions in the class/ asking if someone knows the code or what to do to bring more attention & arousal in students?
I liked everything. Would be great to have a cheatsheet that we can reference for some common graph types.
