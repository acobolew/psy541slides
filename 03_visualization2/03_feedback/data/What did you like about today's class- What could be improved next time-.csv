What did you like about today's class? What could be improved next time?
Response
Good pace!
the pace is good
"Well paced, interesting content, good explanations"
thanks!!! this was very useful
"I liked the pace of the class for most of the time except for the last like 10 minutes when we were just jumping thru the markdown file really quickly, I didn't really understand the shiny parts etc. At the end"
I think maybe it's better to blurb us on what are the more important contents in the rmd files so that we can better preview contents before class!
"It was really fun to get to see more examples of different plots, and I didn't yet know that boxplots wouldn't change based on the underlying distribution!"
Thank you!
This class had a lot more information than last class. The pace was a little faster that last class.
Great class!
Improvement: We didn't get through everything that is on the markdown. Maybe speeding up a tiny bit or just indicating which parts are relevant but are not going to be covered in class
