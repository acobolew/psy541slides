What did you like about today's class? What could be improved next time?
Response
Slow down a little
Useful
appreciated the detail; would love some of the notes/extra things we talk about in lecture included in the classnotes somehow? or maybe we could talk about how to take notes in this class
It was useful to go through R syntax (it felt slow for me but I imagine for those new to programming it was fast). Could be helpful to include secondary activities for people who already have the skill!
great class
maybe using a more pscyh relevant dataset that's generally interesting. pop culture stuff is good too though
starwars dataset was funny
I like the style of the R tutorials that start from the very basics. These are helpful and encouraging to work in R
"The pace was good, I liked the walkthrough and additional explanations not on the cheatsheet"
Thank you for the explanation for the basic R! It was really great to learn the keyboard shortcut
good class!
very clear! thank you
I really liked all the demonstrations in today's class! I feel like it was a great pace!
I liked having the practice sessions
I liked going over what different codes mean â€” both in r and when just thinking about It
