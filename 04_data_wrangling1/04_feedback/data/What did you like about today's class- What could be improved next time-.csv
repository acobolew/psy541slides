What did you like about today's class? What could be improved next time?
Response
It would be helpful if we could take pauses in between transitions giving time for me to load R & download stuff. Or have dates on the schedule so I can do so before hand. Or have announcements before class that let us know what materials we need to have before class. Or if something like this exists if I can have a reminder on where this information is kept.
"N/a. I did want to mention there seems to be a typo in chunk 46? 'hermaphrodite' is a value under sex, not gender, so that the or statement works"
Good overall; maybe more breakout room time/interactive time
I think the pace was great and I was able to keep up for the 1st time!
good! could have gone through the wrangling functions a tiny bit slower
lot of good tips & hacks; more practice trials
"Sooo helpful in explaining things about R that I had been copying from sample code before, but now get why they work (e.g., dots)!"
"Today's class moved a bit too fast for me, particularly through the base R commands and everything after the pipe operator."
always like the practices
"One thing I'd like to request is a slightly longer stretch break.... for instance, 5 minutes instead of 1 minute? That way, there's more time to use the restroom / get a coffee refill, etc. Thanks!"
"can you write the name of the song and submission info on the first slide? If you join class after that info was posted in the chat, it's not visible  to those who join later."
Great class! Thanks for the thorough introduction to R!
I am feeling very concerned about moving to inperson classes especially with a class this size. I would really appreciate staying on zoom/moving to hybrid
I feel like today's class was a bit too fast for me maybe because I'm not super familiar with tidyverse. I'm wondering if there are any resources for practice besides Datacamp?
I really like how comprehensive the introduction to R has been and these markdown files are going to be great resources in the future as well. I really wish there were mini homeworks to practice what we learn and assess how much we learned in class + tie the information together (rather than just having one big homework deliverable). Because it is a little stressful to gauge how deep we are going for the homework and whether or not we have learnt enough!
"the pace was much better today, thank you."
"A bit rushed, but I'm happy we have the recording so I can go back and go through it again :)"
I enjoyed the pace of today's class!
Todays class went by quick. I appreciated last Fridays format: reviewing the previous class materials and then transitioning to the days class.
"Really good! I think today clarified something I knew about R but had some confusion on, like the '.' in variable naming convention."
