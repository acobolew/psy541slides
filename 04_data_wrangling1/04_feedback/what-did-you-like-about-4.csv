The pace was good! It was easier to follow today than last time - thank you for explaining each function as we went and for demonstrating the answer to questions. It would be helpful to have the practice problem answers written somewhere in the document so we can refer to it at home.,2019-01-14 11:52:48
"The pace was really great. If there are a few more opportunities to test out and practice the concepts, that would be helpful. But we did a great job of covering new material quickly and implementing it. It might also be helpful for you to recommend other practice problems for us to do on our own time. I've been reviewing the DataCamp lessons, but I have to sift through a lot of review material to get to more practice.",2019-01-14 11:51:54
a lot! i wonder if i'll be able to get versed with r enough to draw meaningful conclusions,2019-01-14 11:51:35
"Thanks for the class! I know that you had a lot to get through, but I would appreciate more exercises (like the ones we had last week) so the class is a bit more interactive.",2019-01-14 11:51:31
I liked how detailed your examples are. The document is super useful for future reference. More practice and solutions will be good.,2019-01-14 11:51:28
"I liked the variety of functions that we learned about. It was slightly unclear whether the arguments to a function were applied sequentially, such that the arguments were order-sensitive or not.",2019-01-14 11:51:16
I like how you walked through lots of examples. Can we have even more small practice blocks integrated into these sections?,2019-01-14 11:50:42
"Everything is good and pace is just right. The only thing that I am concern is getting the practice answers from the lectures and sessions. Will it be possible for the lecturers and tutors to post the practice answers online, so that people who may have accidentially missed the answers can check it after classes? Thanks!",2019-01-14 11:50:36
"I liked how you showed us different ways to run the same things in R. A little more background on the different functions would be incredibly helpful, but I understand that time is limited",2019-01-14 11:50:26
"Today's class was insanely helpful! I'm realizing how inefficient a lot of my code is. Love that we can make superficial changes to data frames as needed — up until now, I've been creating tons of new data frames, so this is exciting. Thank you!",2019-01-14 11:50:22
The hammer sound doesn't really work. Maybe a bell?,2019-01-14 11:50:17
"I'm a bit stressed on the second practice, the data has been changed since we followed all the commands, and it was a bit challenging scrolling back and forth trying to remember all the commands, perhaps better as after-class / TA session practice?",2019-01-14 11:50:14
I think this was a very informative way of describing many of the useful functions for data wrangling. It was pretty intuitive once you explained it.,2019-01-14 11:50:04
Maybe one more practice (3 total)?,2019-01-14 11:49:57
I think it would be great if you included a compare() function in the starter code so we could make sure our answers to the exercises are correct! Otherwise great class thanks for answering all of my questions,2019-01-14 11:49:52
I think a lot of today's class could have been abbreviated by having folks read through the file before class. This would have left more time for questions/exercises.,2019-01-14 11:49:51
I liked everything. It was great.,2019-01-14 11:49:49
i liked how we went over many uses for a few main functions. 1-2 optional practice problems at the bottom could have been useful for those of us who may have finished the practice problems early. :),2019-01-14 11:49:48
The material we covered today was a super helpful review of useful functions. Thank you!!,2019-01-14 11:49:45
it was good :),2019-01-14 11:49:29
Great succinct explanations. Really useful content. You're awesome. Thank you.,2019-01-14 11:49:27
I liked the walkthrough examples. Very useful.,2019-01-14 11:48:59
